    <h1>Ubuntu Server modifications needed before FreeLCS installation</h1>
    The FreeLCS installation instructions on the main user manual page describe
    installation on <strong>Ubuntu Desktop</strong>. Ubuntu Desktop has a
    graphical user interface and it is very user friendly. There is another
    version of Ubuntu called <strong>Ubuntu server</strong>. It has no
    graphical user interface and because of this it requires more Linux skills
    than the desktop version. Instructions below assume you know your way around
    the Ubuntu Server system.<br>
    <br>
    The default Ubuntu Server installation has some small problems that will
    prevent FreeLCS from working correctly. Locale may be broken and the font
    that FreeLCS uses when printing the loudness history graphics file is not
    installed by default. These problems can be easily corrected.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Fixing Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 Server locale</h2>
    For <strong>Ubuntu 16.04 and newer</strong> use the <a href="Debian_modifications_needed_before_FreeLCS_installation.html#Fixing_Debian_locale">Debian
      method described here</a>.<br>
    <p> </p>
    <br>
    Ubuntu Server locale is not configured correctly by default, this produces
    error messages during program package installation and stops the FreeLCS
    installer.<br>
    <br>
    All following commands must be executed as root.<br>
    <br>
    These next instructions fixes your locale if your language is Finnish (code:
    <strong>fi</strong>). You can find language code for you language in the
    file:&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED</strong> <br>
    Find the line that mentions you language code and <strong>UTF-8</strong>.
    In my case the line is (my language is Finnish):<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>fi_FI.UTF-8&nbsp;&nbsp; UTF-8</strong></div>
    <br>
    Copy the line and put it as the last line of the textfile:&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>/var/lib/locales/supported.d/local</strong><br>
    <br>
    Next you need to take first part of the line above and compose two lines
    text with it and add these lines at the end of the file: &nbsp; <strong>/etc/environment</strong><br>
    In the case of Finnish language the two lines are:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>LC_ALL=fi_FI.UTF-8</strong><br>
      <strong>LANG=fi_FI.UTF-8</strong></div>
    <br>
    Next run the command: <strong>dpkg-reconfigure locales</strong><br>
    <br>
    You need to log out and back in for the changes to take effect.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Fixing history graphics file fonts</h2>
    <br>
    Install liberation fonts:&nbsp; <strong>sudo apt-get install
      fonts-liberation<br>
    </strong><br>
    Next create a link to the font that is used when FreeLCS creates history
    graphics files:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>sudo&nbsp;&nbsp; ln&nbsp;&nbsp;
      /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSans-Regular.ttf&nbsp;&nbsp;
      /usr/share/fonts/truetype/arial.ttf</strong><br>
    <br>

    <h2><a name="Installing FreeLCS on a computer without a graphical user interface"></a>Installing
      FreeLCS on a computer without a graphical user interface</h2>
    If your operating system is Debian, then you need to make some changes to
    the system before FreeLCS installation. <a href="Debian_modifications_needed_before_FreeLCS_installation.html">Instructions
      are here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    If your operating system is Ubuntu Server, then you need to make some
    changes to the system before FreeLCS installation. <a href="Ubuntu_Server_modifications_needed_before_FreeLCS_installation.html">Instructions
      are here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    Ubuntu Server does not have a graphical user interface and Debian can be
    installed also without one. Computers with these version of Linux are most
    likely servers running in a dedicated server room or virtualized in a server
    farm. The only way to access these servers is usually with a ssh connection.<br>
    <br>
    The advantage of a operating system without a GUI is that it uses very
    little physical resources, for example Debian 7 without a GUI uses only 45
    MB of Ram when it starts up. <br>
    <br>
    FreeLCS installation requires a graphical user interface, but there are two
    methods to install it on a "headless" server.<br>
    <ol>
      <li>You can install FreeLCS on a computer that has a graphical user
        interface, make a backup of the installation and restore it on a
        "headless" server. The restoration process can be done over ssh. <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Cloning%20a%20FreeLCS%20installation%20to%20another%20machine%20%28without%20a%20display%29">
          Instructions for this method are here</a>.</li>
      <li>You can use X - forwarding over a ssh connection. This installation
        method is described below.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Installing FreeLCS over ssh with X - forwarding</h2>
    FreeLCS installation requires either a connection to the internet or access
    to a local Debian / Ubuntu package repository.<br>
    <br>
    This method requires two computers: one Linux or OS X machine with the X
    windowing system installed (<strong>Desktop computer</strong>) and the
    target server (<strong>server computer</strong>). When using this method the
    installer runs on the "headless" <strong>server</strong>, but its windows
    will appear on the <strong> Desktop</strong> computer. <br>
    <ul>
      <li>First make an ssh - connection from the <strong>Desktop</strong>
        computer to the <strong>server</strong> with the following command
        (replace the username with an actual username on the server and the ip
        with the actual ip of the server):</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>ssh&nbsp;&nbsp; -l&nbsp;&nbsp;
        username &nbsp; 192.168.1.1</strong></p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li value="2">Now add the following line in the file:&nbsp; <strong>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        on the <strong>server</strong>:</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>X11Forward yes</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Now quit the ssh connection and create it again now using X -
        forwarding:</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>ssh&nbsp; -Y&nbsp; -C&nbsp;
        -l&nbsp;&nbsp; username &nbsp; 192.168.1.1</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      (If this does not work try replacing the option -Y with -X).<strong><br>
      </strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>You might get the message "<strong>.Xauthority does not exist</strong>".
        This is not an error, but an announcement telling that the file in
        question did not exist and it is now created. Next time you make the
        connection you should no longer see this message.</li>
      <li>The following commands are all executed on the <strong>server</strong>
        over the ssh - connection.</li>
      <li>Update the package database. Installation may fail to fetch some
        needed packages, if the package database is out of date.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>sudo apt-get update</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Install programs needed during FreeLCS installation:</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>sudo&nbsp; apt-get -y&nbsp;
        install&nbsp; python3&nbsp; idle3&nbsp; zip&nbsp; unzip</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Download FreeLCS installer. If a newer FreeLCS package is available
        replace the name of the zip-file:</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>wget&nbsp;
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/freelcs/files/FreeLCS-3.0.zip</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Unzip the package:</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>unzip FreeLCS-3.0.zip</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the unzipped archive directory: </li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>cd freelcs</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Run FreeLCS installer:</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>./installer.py</strong></div>
    <br>
    Now after a few seconds the window of the installer program should appear on
    the <strong>Desktop</strong> computer, even though the installer really
    runs on the <strong>server</strong>. Now you can follow the <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Installer_starts">Ubuntu
      Desktop installation instructions.</a><br>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Note !!!!!!! </strong>When installing using this method on
      Ubuntu Server 18.04 there seems to be a bug that won't let you write the
      character @ to the installer window (used in email addresses). Please
      write the character on a terminal on your Desktop computer and copy /
      paste it to the installer window. This bug seems only to exist on Ubuntu
      18.04.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="Automatic security updates on Ubuntu Server and Debian"></a>Automatic
      security updates on Ubuntu Server and Debian</h2>
    These instructions apply to <strong>Ubuntu Server</strong> and <strong>Debian</strong>.
    If your operating system is <strong>Ubuntu Desktop</strong>, then you can
    do the configuration more easily with graphical tools. <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Setting%20up%20automatic%20security%20updates">Instructions
      for Ubuntu Desktop are here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    The next intructions sets the operating system to install all security
    updates automatically.<br>
    <br>
    All following instructions must be run as the <strong>root</strong> user.<br>
    <ul>
      <li> Install the software needed for automatic updates: </li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>apt-get install unattended-upgrades</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li> Then you need to configure the software we installed:</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>dpkg-reconfigure -plow
        unattended-upgrades</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>The configuration program will as if you want to install updates
        automatically, answer "<strong>Yes</strong>".</li>
      <li>Then we need to change some settings, open the configfile</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>nano -w
        /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>On Ubuntu</strong>: Check that the following line is <strong>not</strong>
        commented out. The characters //&nbsp; are used for commenting.</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>"${distro_id}:${distro_codename}-security";</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>(<strong>On Debian</strong>: Check that the following line is <strong>not</strong>
        commented out. The characters //&nbsp; are used for commenting).</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>"origin=Debian,archive=stable,label=Debian-Security";</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Then we need to edit another text file, <strong>on Ubuntu</strong>
        open the file to text editor with the following command:</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>nano -w /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>(<strong>On Debian</strong> open the file to text editor with the
        following command):</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>nano -w
        /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>and add the following lines to the text file:</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <strong>APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists
        "1";</strong><br>
      <strong> APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "1";</strong><br>
      <strong> APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "30";</strong><br>
      <strong> APT::Periodic::Unattended-Upgrade "1";</strong></div>
    <br>
    The settings we made define that the server will download and install
    security updates daily. The downloaded installation packages are deleted
    after 30 days.<br>
    <br>
    When updates are installed then details about the installation are recorded
    to log files in directory:<br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>/var/log/unattended-upgrades/</strong></div>
    <br>
    <br>
    Now you can setup <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Boot_Once_A_Week">automatic
      reboot once a week</a> so that kernel updates are applied.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="Static ip - address for Ubuntu Server and Debian without a GUI">Static
        ip - address for Ubuntu Server and Debian without a GUI</a></h2>
    In this example we assing the static ip-address of <strong>192.168.1.1</strong>
    to the network interface <strong>eth0</strong>. The default <strong>gateway</strong>
    to the internet is the computer at address: <strong>192.168.1.200</strong>.
    We use OpenDNS - service as our name servers (ip-addresses: 208.67.222.222,
    208.67.220.220). You need to change these settings to correspond to your
    network environment.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Important note:</strong><br>
    <br>
    Don't try to change network settings on a remote server through a ssh -
    connection. There is always the possibility that something goes wrong and
    you are not able to connect to the server anymore.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the network interface configuration file to a text editor as
        root:</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>sudo nano -w /etc/network/interfaces</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>First remove the line that says "<strong>iface eth0 inet dhcp</strong>"
        and then add the following&nbsp; lines below it:</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>auto eth0<br>
        iface eth0 inet static</strong><br>
      <strong>address 192.168.1.1</strong><br>
      <strong>netmask 255.255.255.0</strong><br>
      <strong>gateway 192.168.1.200<br>
        dns-nameservers&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>208.67.222.222&nbsp;&nbsp;
      </strong><strong>208.67.220.220</strong></div>
    <br>
    You may need to reboot the computer for the changes to take effect.<br>
