    <h1> Debian modifications needed before FreeLCS installation</h1>
    Debian support was added in FreeLCS version 3.0. Later Debian releases are
    also supported by FreeLCS.<br>
    <br>
    Canonical builds its Ubuntu releases using Debian software packages.
    Therefore both of these Linux distributions have much in common, but also
    have some differences. Some small config changes must be made to Debian
    before FreeLCS can be installed and run.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Remove cd / dvd installation media from sources.list</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Debian adds the install cd / dvd as a available repository for
        software package installation. When you install new software then Debian
        first tries to find it on the installation cd / dvd. If the disk is not
        inserted, then installation stops with an error message. This prevents
        FreeLCS from installing the software packages it needs. The installation
        disk must be removed from the list of available installation sources.
        This list is a simple text file that can be manually edited.</li>
      <li>Open the Terminal (<strong> /Applications/Accessories/Terminal </strong>)
        and get root provileges by giving the following command (will ask for
        root password):</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>su root</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the installation source list to a text editor in the terminal
        with the following command:</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>nano -w /etc/apt/sources.list</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find lines that start with:&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>deb cdrom&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        and add a&nbsp; <strong>#</strong>&nbsp; character in front of each.
        This disables the line.</li>
      <li>Example: the following line:</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 9.4.0
        _Stretch_ - Official amd64 DVD Binary-1 20180310-11:21]/ stretch contrib
        main</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>becomes:</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong># deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 9.4.0
        _Stretch_ - Official amd64 DVD Binary-1 20180310-11:21]/ stretch contrib
        main</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Save the modified file using the keyboard command: <strong>ctrl + o</strong></li>
      <li>Exit the nano - editor with keyboard command: <strong>ctrl + x</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Install the sudo - program and add user to the sudo group</h2>
    FreeLCS uses the <strong>sudo</strong> - program to get root permissions
    during installation. If sudo is not available then FreeLCS installation
    fails.<br>
    <br>
    Debian installs sudo if you selected the 'Desktop' - installation during
    Debian install process. To ensure that sudo is installed, try to reinstall
    it:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Get root permissions with the following terminal command (asks for
        root password):</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>su -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      (Starting with Debian 10 you need to get root permissions by: <strong>su
        -</strong>&nbsp; or root-users path definitions may not be accessible
      and some commands might not be found)</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Install the sudo package:</li>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>apt-get -y install sudo</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>The user account that you use to run the FreeLCS installer must have
        permission to run the sudo - program. This permission is given by adding
        the user to the group named '<strong>sudo</strong>'. In the following
        example we assume that the name of this user account is&nbsp;
        'john'.&nbsp; Change this name to your actual user account name.</li>
      <li>Add the user account to the group '<strong>sudo</strong>' with the
        following terminal command:</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>adduser&nbsp;&nbsp; john&nbsp;&nbsp;
        sudo</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you are logged in with the user account that you added to the group
        'sudo', then you must now log out and back in for the changes to take
        effect.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li> If sudo installation gives you the error: "<strong>unable to locate
          package sudo</strong>", then some of the required package repositories
        are missing from the text file:&nbsp; <strong>/etc/apt/sources.list</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Below you can see an example of my working sources.list. You must
        run&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>apt-get update</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; after you
        make changes to the package repository settings so that the database for
        available packages gets updated.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 style="margin-left: 40px;">Debian 10:</h3>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"># deb cdrom:[Debian GNU/Linux 10.0.0 _Buster_

    <p>If you did not install a graphical desktop during Debian install, then
      you need to do two more modifications described below. If you did install
      a graphical desktop then you can go ahead with the <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Installation">normal
        FreeLCS install procedure described in the user manual</a> :)</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="Fixing_Debian_locale">Fixing Debian / Ubuntu locale</a></h2>
    Debian and Ubuntu 16.04 and newer locale can be fixed by using the method
    described below.<br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    If you installed a graphical desktop during Debian installation, then your
    locale should be configured correctly, if not then you should configure it
    before FreeLCS installation. Locale error messages during program package
    installation stops the FreeLCS installer.<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Run the command:</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>su -</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (On
      debian)</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>sudo su</strong> (On Ubuntu)</p>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>dpkg-reconfigure locales</strong></div>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Select your locale from the list. Search for your language and the
        text "UTF-8". I have selected the Finnish language (<strong>fi_FI.UTF-8</strong>)
        in the picture below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="Pictures/Debian_Locale_Configuration-01.png"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Next window asks you to decide which locale is the system default. In
        the picture below I chose the default to be english us.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="Pictures/Debian_Locale_Configuration-02.png"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Now you need to log out and back in for the locale changes to take effect.<br>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>If you installed Debian graphical desktop then continue with <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Installation"
        title="Installation">normal install instructions here</a>. If you didn't
      install a graphical desktop then follow the <a href="Ubuntu_Server_modifications_needed_before_FreeLCS_installation.html"

        instructions here</a>.</p>
