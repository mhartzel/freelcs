    <h2> <a id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
    FreeLCS stands for <strong>Free Loudness Correction Server</strong>. The
    software lets you easily set up a server that shares one of it's folders to
    the network where users can drop audio files to be loudness corrected
    according to the EBU R128 loudness recommendation. The server also creates a
    loudness history graphics file which gives visual feedback of the internal
    loudness variations in a file.<br>
    <br>
    The software is very fast even on modest hardware giving 15 times faster
    than realtime processing (16 bit stereo files, TruePeak measurement turned
    on) on a server with one Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 2 GB Ram, 3 internal
    Sata disks in software RAID 0. <br>
    <br>
    FreeLCS uses other open source programs to get the job done (Linux,
    libebur128, gnuplot, FFmpeg (optional), sox, mediainfo).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> <a id="Features">Features</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Calculates loudness according to EBU R128 for files dropped into the
        HotFolder.</li>
      <li>For each file it creates a loudness history graphics file which gives
        visual feedback of the loudness variations in the file.</li>
      <li>Creates loudness corrected versions of each file dropped in the
        servers HotFolder.</li>
      <li>Natively supports <strong>wav</strong>, <strong>flac</strong> and <strong>ogg</strong>
        formats.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If user installs FFmpeg then all formats supported by it can be
        processed. FFmpeg supports a large number of formats.<br>
      </li>
      <li> Supports files with several audio streams. Each stream is demuxed to
        a separate file and loudness corrected.</li>
      <li>Even video files can be dropped in for processing. Audio streams are
        demuxed from the file and processed.<br>
      </li>
      <li> Supports channel counts from mono to 5.1.</li>
      <li> Takes advantage of multiple processor cores to run calculations
        simultaneously.</li>
      <li>Uses a protective limiter to prevent clipping in cases where volume
        must be increased.<br>
      </li>
      <li> Automatic file deletion after a set time.</li>
      <li>Possible error messages are emailed to the admin.</li>
      <li>All software is free and Open Source.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Very easy to use, just drop in your file and copy back the corrected
        version.</li>
      <li>Easy to integrate in many workflows.</li>
      <li>Modest hardware requirements.</li>
      <li>Written in Python 3.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h2> <a id="Requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You need a computer with at least 2 processor cores.</li>
      <li>2 GB of RAM&nbsp; (there probably is not much advantage in having
        more).</li>
      <li> Ubuntu Linux 12.04. This version of Ubuntu will be supported by
        Canonical until April 2017, meaning there will be security updates for 5
        years after the release.</li>
      <li>A person that is able to set up and update an Linux server.</li>
      <li>1 Gbit ethernet is recommended.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;The <a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html">FAQ</a> discusses things like
        supported formats, channel orders, etc.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><u><strong>Note:</strong></u><br>
    </p>
    Only files that have all audio channels of the mix in the same audiofile or
    audiostream can be processed. For example you cannot process a 5.1 mix that
    is split up to 6 separate files. Loudness calculation won't know these files
    belong together.<br>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> <a id="Installation">Installation</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>First install Ubuntu 12.04. If you don't know whether to choose 32 or
        64 bit version, use the 32 bit one if you have less than 4 GB of ram and
        64 bit if you have more.</li>
      <li>It is recommended to use the JFS - filesystem for all disks, since the
        default filesystem ext4 has some quite serious bugs / design flaws that
        are probably never going to be fixed. JFS was designed by IBM to be a
        very fault tolerant filesystem for big database servers. It is able to
        survive power outages and has been in serious production use for years.<br>
      </li>
      <li>During the installation of Ubuntu, you are prompted to create the
        first user. It is important to use a password for this account, do not
        leave the password empty.<br>
      </li>
      <li>After Ubuntu is installed log in as the first user you created during
        installation.</li>
      <li>Next you must install <strong>python3</strong> and <strong>idle3</strong>.
        Press the "windows" key on the keyboard to bring up Ubuntu search
        function, write: <strong>term</strong><br>
        You should now see an icon for "Terminal", start it up by clicking on
        it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img alt="" src="Pictures/Terminal-01.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write the following command in the terminal window (you can copy and
        paste it from below. Note that that keyboard command for paste in
        Terminal is: <strong>shift + ctrl + v</strong>):</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>sudo apt-get -y install python3 idle3<br>
          </strong></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Press enter to run the command.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
      <strong></strong></p>
    <p><img alt="" src="Pictures/Terminal-02.jpg"><br>
      <strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong><br>
      </strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote> </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>The command will ask for your password. Type in the password and press
        enter and python3 installation begins.<strong><br>
        </strong></li>
      <li>Now that python3 is installed you can start the FreeLCS installation
        program, it will ask you some details about how you would like the
        loudness correction server to work and installs the rest of the programs
        FreeLCS needs.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Next unzip the FreeLCS - package by clicking it with the right mouse
        button and selecting " <strong>Extract Here</strong>". A new directory
        will be created and all FreeLCS files will be unzipped there.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Installation-00.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Next we need to make the installer program executable. Navigate to the
        directory that unzip created and right click the "<strong>installer.py</strong>"
        program and select "<strong>Properties</strong>" from the menu.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <img src="Pictures/Installation-01.jpg"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Click the "<strong>Permissions</strong>" tab and select "<strong>Allow
          executing file as program</strong>" and the click "<strong>Close</strong>".
        The installer program can now be run.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Installation-02.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Double click the "<strong>installer.py</strong>" - file. A window will
        appear, click "<strong>Run</strong>".<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Installation-02-2.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The installer program starts. The first screen asks you to accept the
        license agreement.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS is published under a permissive license that lets you use,
        modify and distribute the program.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="Pictures/Installation-15.jpg">
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click "<strong>Next</strong>" when you have read the next window.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Installation-03.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The next screen will ask some details about how you would like
        loudness correction to work.</li>
      <li>The first section will allow you to define the path to the target
        directory. Some directories are automatically created inside this target
        directory, the most important of these is the '<strong>HotFolder</strong>'.
        HotFolder is the folder where users can drop in files for processing.
        HotFolder is by default located in: '<strong>Target Directory /
          LoudnessCorrection</strong>'.</li>
      <li>The second section allows you to select English or Finnish as the
        language for directories and text in loudness history graphics files.</li>
      <li>'<strong>Number of processor cores to use</strong>' lets you define
        how many processor cores are used in loudness calculation and file
        processing. When a file is being processed it always ties up two
        processor cores. The speed of processing is most often dependent of the
        raw speed of disks. If your HotFolder is on an fast disk for example a
        Raid device, then it often speeds up processing if you select here more
        processor cores than you actually have. For example for our test server
        that has one Intel Core 2 Duo (dual core) processor, 2 GB of Ram, 3 x 1
        TB Sata - disks in Raid 0 for HotFolder, the sweet spot for speed is six
        cores even though we only have two. See: <a href="#%20Optimizing%20processing%20speed">Optimizing
          processing speed.</a><br>
      </li>
      <li>The last section of the window lets you define how long files are
        allowed to stay on the server before they are automatically deleted. The
        default value here is 8 hours (480 minutes).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Installation-04.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The next window lets you select if you want to email possible error
        messages to the admin.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Input your email details here. Smtp - server is the email server you
        use to send email out to the world. (Note that if you use <strong>Gmail</strong>,
        the settings to use are displayed printed in light gray).<br>
      </li>
      <li>You can add max 5 addresses that the messages are sent to. When you
        have filled in email details, click the "Send" - button to test that
        email sending really works. The bottom of the window displays a message
        if email sending is succesful.</li>
      <li><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Gmail two-factor authentication is
        not supported. Google calls this feature two-step verification.<br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>HeartBeat Checker</strong> is a separate program that monitors
        the health of the loudness correction program. If Loudness correction
        crashes for some reason, HeartBeat Checker sends you email. If your
        loudness correction server is mission critical then enable this option.</li>
      <li>(Note that the password you give here is not encrypted when it is
        stored in the file "<strong>/etc/LoudnessCorrection_Settings.pickle</strong>".
        Scripts can not securely encrypt anything since the scripts themselves
        can be easily read and any encryption method used can be seen by
        examining the source code :)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="Pictures/Installation-05.jpg"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The next window lets you select if you want "<a href="#Html%20Progress%20report"><strong>Html
            progress report</strong></a>" written to the HotFolder. It is an
        html-page that can be viewed with a web-browser and it displays the
        loudness calculation queue inside the server. On the page you can see
        how many files are waiting to be processed and names of the last 100
        processed files and times they were processed. The "<strong>html
          progress report</strong>" is a tool for the admin to see what's going
        on inside the server, this feature is not needed by normal users.
        Current time is displayed on the page also and if it is advancing then
        the server is alive and well :) The default path for the "Html progress
        report" is "<strong>Target Directory / LoudnessCorrection /
          00-Calculation_Queue_Information /
          00-Calculation_Queue_Information.html</strong>".<br>
      </li>
      <li>The "Html progress report" is updated once in every 5 seconds. During
        heavy file traffic the disk can become so busy that loudness correction
        is not able to write the progress report on the disk as often as it
        tries and if you view the page it seems to be frozen. This problem can
        be solved by creating a ram-disk and writing the "Html progress report"
        there instead of hard disk. Ram-disks can be written and read very
        quickly and traffic jams on hard disks don't affect them at all.</li>
      <li>If you wan't the progress report to be written on a ram-disk, then you
        can select which of the operating systems ram-devices are used to create
        the ram disk. You need to change the default setting of "<strong>/dev/ram1</strong>"
        here only if you know you have created other ram-disks for other
        purposes and you know that device "/dev/ram1" is already used for
        something else.</li>
      <li>Then you can select which user account is used when loudness
        correction and heartbeat checker programs are run. These two programs
        are always run as an "unprivileged" user. If you only created one user,
        then this user is used by default.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If you are not sure what to select for options described above, then
        just leave the defaults as they are. Defaults are ok for most users :)</li>
      <li>The last option on this window lets you select which peak measurement
        method you want to use: <strong>sample peak</strong> or <strong>TruePeak</strong>.
        TruePeak is a method that takes into account invisible peaks that might
        exist between audio samples. These peaks can go above the maximum
        allowed 0 dBFS and cause distortion in DA - converters. TruePeak
        measurement finds these hidden peaks and gives the true maximum peak
        value in a file. TruePeak calculation slows down file processing by a
        factor of 4. Sample peak simply finds the highest sample value in the
        file and uses that as the highest peak value.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The peak value is only important when loudness of a file falls below
        the target -23 LUFS and needs to be increased. There is the possibility
        that peaks will distort after the gain correction. In these cases a
        protective limiter is used. If peak value after gain correction would go
        over a set limit (-4 dBFS for sample peaks and -2 dBFS for TruePeaks),
        then the file is limited before gain correction. The resulting peaks
        after gain correction will be max. 1 dB higher than the set limit
        resulting in max -3 dBFS / -1 dBFS peaks. Note that if you use sample
        peak, there will always be 3 dB headroom for the invisible peaks to
        exist and distortion is very unlikely. If you are unsure what to use
        then select sample peak here, it is ok for most users.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The next window will let you select if you want the "HotFolder" to be
        shared to the network. Select "Yes" if you want users to be able to drop
        in files to the HotFolder through the network.</li>
      <li>If you select "Yes" the the samba-server is used for creating the
        network share and the default samba configuration is shown on the
        window. You can edit the configuration, but only change it if you know
        your&nbsp; settings will work in your network. In all other cases just
        leave the configuration as it is and click "Next".<br>
      </li>

    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The next window asks for the "root" - users password. It is the same
        password that you set up for the first user you created during Ubuntu
        installation. The root password is needed when FreeLCS files are written
        into Linux system directories.<br>
      </li>

    <p><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The next window will list all external programs that FreeLCS needs.
        Just click the "<strong>Install</strong>" - button and the installer
        will download and install everything for you. (It will also download
        libebur128 source code, compile and install it).</li>
      <li>The "<strong>Toggle</strong>" button can be used to force
        reinstallation of all programs. You might need this if for example
        libebur128 has just released an updated version which implements latest
        changes in EBU R128 recommendation and you want this version right away.
        The Toggle - button changes the state of all programs to "Not Installed"
        and clicking it again changes the state back.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The installation takes a couple of minutes and the window freezes
        while the installer launches external programs to do the actual
        installation. So don't try to click on anything on the window while the
        installation is going on. The installer shows messages on the bottom of
        the screen telling what it is doing at the moment.</li>
      <li>After all required programs are installed, the installer installs
        FreeLCS scripts into Ubuntu's system folders. <br>
      </li>

    <h2><a id="Files that FreeLCS creates in your system">Files that FreeLCS
        creates in your system</a></h2>
    FreeLCS is made up of these files:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>/etc/init.d/loudnesscorrection_init_script</strong><br>
    <br>
    This script starts up all FreeLCS programs. The script is started by a link
    in the <strong>/etc/rc2.d</strong> - folder when the computer starts up
    (See the file below). This file creates the ram disk, creates directories in
    the HotFolder if they do not exist and sets their permissions so that
    network users can not delete critical files and folders in the HotFolder.
    This script also starts up LoudnessCorrection.py and HeartBeat_Checker.py -
    programs.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>/etc/rc2.d/S99loudnesscorrection_init_script</strong><br>
    <br>
    This file is a link that points to "<strong>/etc/init.d/loudnesscorrection_init_script</strong>"
    &nbsp; this link is used to start up "<strong>/etc/init.d/loudnesscorrection_init_script</strong>"
    when the computer starts up. Without this link the script "<strong>loudnesscorrection_init_script</strong>"
    won't run.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>/usr/bin/LoudnessCorrection.py</strong><br>
    <br>
    This is the main program of FreeLCS. It is the one that processes all files
    dropped into HotFolder.<br>
    <strong><br>
      /usr/bin/HeartBeat_Checker.py</strong><br>
    &nbsp;<br>
    This program is started only if you selected it in the installer. It
    monitors the health of the LoudnessCorrection.py - program and sends email
    if LoudnessCorrection crashes.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>/etc/LoudnessCorrection_Settings.pickle<br>
      <br>
    </strong>The settings that you defined when running the installer are stored
    in this file. LoudnessCorrection.py and HeartBeat_Checker.py both read their
    settings from this file when they start up.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>/etc/samba/smb.conf</strong><br>
    <br>
    This is the configuration file for the samba server that shares the
    HotFolder to the network. Hotfolder is shared to the network only if you
    selected "<strong>Share HotFolder to the network with samba</strong>"&nbsp;
    =&nbsp; "<strong>yes</strong>" in the installer.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> <a id="Usage">Usage</a></h2>
    FreeLCS usage is very simple.
    <ol>
      <li>First you mount FreeLCS HotFolder through the network. </li>
      <li>Then you drag some files to the HotFolder .</li>
      <li>A couple of minutes later you can drag loudness corrected files back
        from "<strong>HotFolder / 00-Corrected_Files</strong>" to your computer
        .</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    Mounting of the HotFolder is explained in it's own chapter.<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>When you mount the HotFolder your operating system automatically opens
        a window that shows the contents of the HotFolder. The examples below
        are from Mac OS X, but the same principles apply to all operating
        systems.</li>
      <li>The root of HotFolder is where you drag files you want to be loudness
        corrected.</li>
      <li>Inside the root - folder there are two other folders: "<strong>00-Corrected_Files</strong>"
        is where corrected files and loudness calculation history graphics
        appear. The folder "<strong>00-Calculation_Queue_Information</strong>"
        is used to store two files that normally aren't of interest to normal
        users. The first one is "<strong>00-Calculation_Queue_Information.html</strong>".
        That is an html-file that can be opened in a web-browser. The page is
        updated every 5 seconds and it shows how many files are waiting to be
        processed, which files are currently worked upon and so on. The second
        file that is stored in this folder is "<strong>00-HeartBeat.pickle</strong>".
        LoudnessCorrection writes periodically timestamps and other information
        in this file and HeartBeat_Checker.py monitors this file. If information
        in the file stops updating then LoudnessCorrection has crashed and
        HeartBeat_Checker sends email to the admin.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Usage-01.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For normal users the only folders of interest are the root of the
        HotFolder and the "<strong>HotFolder / 00-Corrected_Files</strong>".</li>
      <li>To process a file drag it in the root of the HotFolder.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Usage-02.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The file will be copied over the network to the FreeLCS - server.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Usage-03.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>When the file is copied over navigate to "<strong>00-Corrected_Files</strong>".<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Usage-04.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In a while files start to appear there. The first file will be the
        loudness calculation history graphics file and some time after that the
        loudness corrected sound file appears. Drag the corrected sound files
        back to your computer. Each corrected file will have the string&nbsp; "<strong>_-23_LUFS</strong>"
        added at the end of its name.</li>
      <li>All files in the root of the "<strong>HotFolder</strong>" and&nbsp; "<strong>00-Corrected_Files</strong>"
        will be automatically deleted after a time period that you defined in
        the installer program. By default it is 8 hours.<br>

    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A loudness history graphics file shows loudness variations and other
        loudness calculation results for the original uncorrected file.</li>
      <li>The brown line shows the short-term loudness, it shows how loudness
        varies across time in the file.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The bright green horizontal line shows the EBU R128 target level that
        is -23 on the LUFS scale (0 LU also means -23 LUFS).</li>
      <li>The dark green horizontal line shows the integrated loudness of your
        file. It averages the loudness across the length of your whole file into
        a single number. This is the loudness of the file and it must be at -23
        LUFS to be at the target level according to the EBU R128 recommendation.</li>
      <li>All files will be loudness corrected to have integrated loudness of
        -23 LUFS.<br>

    <h2><a id=" Optimizing processing speed"> Optimizing processing speed</a></h2>
    If you have a fast enough processor, for example 1 x Intel Core 2 Duo, then
    the processor is able to process files much quicker than a single hard disk
    is able to serve it. When multiple files are processed at the same time,
    there will be lots of reading and writing going on and the speed of the disk
    becomes the bottleneck of the system. You can get more speed out of you
    system by setting up three disks in a raid 0 array and putting the HotFolder
    onto the raid.<br>
    <br>
    The other thing that affects processing speed is the setting "<strong>Number
      Of Processor Cores To Use</strong>" in the installer. Each file that is
    processed ties up two processor cores, but if you have a fast disk and a
    hyper-threading capable processor, you might get more speed by setting the
    "Number Of Processor Cores To Use" to a bigger number than you have actual
    physical processor cores.<br>
    <br>
    After you have set up raid you can find the sweet spot of your system by
    doing a simple test.<br>
    <br>
    First collect a bunch of typical files that the server is going to process
    when doing real work. The total size of the files should at minimum be
    double the size of ram you have in your server, but more files is better.
    Save the files on the server, but don't put them in the HotFolder yet.<br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Delete all files from the HotFolder.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Run the FreeLCS installer and set the "<strong>Number Of Processor
          Cores To Use</strong>" to the number of physical processor cores you
        have and reboot.</li>
      <li>Wait for two minutes after the computer has booted up so that
        LoudnessCorrection has time to start up. (There is a deliberate 90
        second delay before LoudnessCorrection is started up).</li>
      <li>Open the html-progress report in your web-browser and see that the
        time displayed on the page is advancing. If not then LoudnessCorrection
        is not yet running.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Now you need to make the test files appear in the HotFolder. The
        quickest way to make this happen is to create hard links for the test
        files in the HotFolder. This makes the files appear immediately without
        making physical copies of the files.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote><strong>date&nbsp; ;&nbsp; ln&nbsp;&nbsp;
          /path_to_test_files/*&nbsp;&nbsp; /path_to_hotfolder/</strong></blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li>This command displays the current time which also is the time files
        were linked to the HotFolder, take note of the time.</li>
      <li>Wait for processing to finish and take a look at the html-progress
        report and see the time the last files processing finished.</li>
      <li>Calculate the time it took.</li>
      <li>Repeat the process from step 1, but add two to the "<strong>Number Of
          Processor Cores To Use</strong>" in the installer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You should find the fastest processing time in 2 - 4 rounds of the test.</p>
    <p><br>
      Our test servers sweet spot is to use six cores even though there is only
      two physical processor cores. Our test server specs are:<br>
      <br>
      1 x Intel Core 2 Duo Processor<br>
      2 GB Ram<br>
      1 TB hard disk for Ubuntu<br>
      3 x 1 TB hard disks in a software raid 0 array for the "HotFolder".<br>
      1 Gbit Ethernet</p>
    <br>
    The speed test results for our test server were:<br>
    <br>

    <h2> <a id="Configuring software Raid">Configuring software Raid</a></h2>
    Linux software raid configuration is a bit out of the scope of this document
    and I don't have much experience with it :) Here are the steps that were
    required to get our server's raid set up. The steps I followed were mostly
    from here: <a href="http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch26_:_Linux_Software_RAID">http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch26_:_Linux_Software_RAID</a><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Warning !!!!!!!&nbsp; Linux knowledge is required here. If you are not
    careful these commands can mess up your system&nbsp; :)<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Install 3 Sata disks in the computer. Ubuntu gave our disks
        device-names: <strong>sdb, sdc , sdd.<br>
        </strong></li>
      <li>Get root-permission with the command: <strong>sudo su</strong><br>
      </li>
      <li>Partition each disk as type: <strong>Primary</strong>, &nbsp; <strong>fd
          (Linux raid autodetect)</strong>.</li>
      <li>Install Linux raid software: <strong>apt-get install mdadm</strong></li>
      <li>Create a raid 0 device from the three disks: <strong>mdadm --verbose
          --create /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
          /dev/sdd1</strong></li>
      <li>If mdadm complains that: "Device Or Resource Busy", then mdadm may
        already be using some of the disks and you need to tell it not to. The
        command: <strong>cat /proc/mdstat</strong>&nbsp; lists currently
        existing raid-devices, stop them with the command (device name is md127
        in the example, check the real device name from the output of: cat
        /proc/mdstat): <strong>mdadm --stop /dev/md127</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        now try creating the raid-device again with the command on the previous
        line.</li>
      <li>When raid-device creation succeeds without error messages, format the
        raid device with the <strong>JFS</strong> filesystem: <strong>mkfs.jfs
          /dev/md0</strong></li>
      <li>Now the raid device exists, but Linux forgets about it in the next
        boot unless we tell it to configure it again when booting up. The next
        commands will save the configuration:</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>cd /etc/mdadm</strong></p>
        <p><strong>mv mdadm.conf mdadm.conf.orig</strong></p>
        <p><strong>echo "DEVICE partitions" &gt; /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</strong></p>
        <p><strong>mdadm --detail --scan &gt;&gt; /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Next make a directory for mounting the raid:<strong> mkdir&nbsp;
          -p&nbsp; /mountpoint/raid-disk</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and make it
        readable and writable for everyone:<strong> chmod -R 777 &nbsp;</strong><strong>
          /mountpoint</strong></li>
      <li>Get the <strong>Universally Unique IDentifier</strong> (UUID) for the
        raid disk with command: <strong>blkid /dev/md0</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; the command will show output like below:<strong></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>/dev/</strong><strong>md0</strong><strong>:
        UUID="229f0670-c8c2-4145-b2f4-b1100d9cb918" TYPE="jfs"</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add the device to your <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> so that it gets
        automatically mounted next time the computer starts up. It is important
        to use the <strong>UUID</strong> instead of the device name (/dev/md0)
        to identify your raid disk in fstab. When the kernel gets updated then
        your raid device number may change (for example from: <strong>/dev/md0</strong>&nbsp;
        to&nbsp; <strong>/dev/md127</strong>) and if you used the device name +
        number in fstab then the disk won't mount anymore. The UUID of a device
        will not change and it can be used to identify the disk instead of its
        device name. (Your disk gets a randomly selected new UUID every time it
        is reformatted).</li>
      <li>Add the following line in <strong> /etc/fstab </strong>(change the
        UUID to match your disk): <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>UUID=229f0670-c8c2-4145-b2f4-b1100d9cb918&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            /mountpoint/raid-disk &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            auto&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defaults&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 0</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Now reboot the machine and if the raid-disk was successfully mounted
        then make the directory structure on the raid-device readable and
        writable for everyone: <strong>chmod -R 777 &nbsp;</strong><strong>
          /mountpoint</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2> <a id="Notes on loudness correction usage">Notes on loudness
        correction usage</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Never process audio channels from the same mix separately from each
        other. Processing left and right channels of a stereo mix separately
        results in loudness being 3 dBs too high. All audio channels of a mix
        must be in the same file or audiostream of a file.</li>
      <li>Silence does not affect loudness calculation. You can cut off silence
        after loudness correction without affecting the integrated loudness of a
        file.<br>
      </li>
      <li>It might sometimes be useful to 'normalize' raw material early in the
        video editing phase of a project. You might have a project that is made
        up of several independent parts that need to be loudness corrected
        separately. An example of this might be a program where a studio host
        talks and plays cartoons for kids. The studio sections of the program
        and each cartoon will have different loudness characteristics.&nbsp;
        After you have loudness corrected each section separately there might
        not be any need for audio post production anymore.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Loudness correction does not touch the internal dynamics of a file. If
        you have too wide loudness variations in a file they will be there also
        after loudness correction. Correction only adjusts the 'main level' of a
        file. If integrated loudness of a file is -19 LUFS, loudness correction
        will make all parts of the file 4 dBs quieter and relative loudness
        variations inside the file will remain the same. This is how EBU R128 is
        designed to work, you can still have loud and soft parts in your mix,
        but it is your responsibility to use them wisely :)<br>
      </li>
      <li>FFmpeg seems to support MXF - files also, but processing MXF might be
        problematic. Inside an MXF - file audio channels of a mix might be
        stored together in one file or separately and loudness correction has no
        way of knowing what is the case. Loudness correction only works
        correctly when all channel of a mix are in the same file.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    The server can be made quite maintenance free by:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Making the server boot automatically after an power outage.</li>
      <li>Making the server install all security updates automatically.</li>
      <li>Making the server automatically reboot weekly so that all security
        updates are applied.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    To make the server boot automatically after an power outage you need to find
    an option in the computers <strong>bios</strong> that says something like:
    "Restart after power failure".<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Then tell Ubuntu to install security updates without human
        intervention.</li>
      <li>Press the "windows" key on the keyboard to bring up Ubuntu search
        function, write: <strong>update</strong></li>
      <li>You should now see an icon for "Update Manager", start it up by
        clicking on it.<br>

    </p>
    <p>Now security updates are downloaded and installed automatically. Some of
      them are applied immediately but some of them (new versions of the Linux
      kernel) may come into effect only after a reboot.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Next we need to make the computer restart automatically once a week. A
        good time to reboot might be for example:<strong> every monday morning
          at 07:00 am</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Cron </strong>can be used to run commands at preset times.
        The configuration for Cron is called <strong>Crontab</strong>. It is a
        simple text file and we add our commands to it using a text editor.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Open a terminal an write in the command: (asks for root password):</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>sudo crontab -e</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Ubuntu will prompt:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b><i>no crontab for root - using an empty one<br>
              <br>

              &nbsp; 4. /usr/bin/vim.tiny<br>
              <br>
              Choose 1-4 [2]:</i></b> </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This means that Ubuntu wants to know which text based text editor you
      would like to use to edit the crontab - file, press "2". This will select
      the "nano" - text editor.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Now the text editor opens up in Terminal and shows some text that Ubuntu
      automatically inserted into the crontab, navigate to the bottom of it and
      add the following line:<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote><strong>00 07 * * 1 /sbin/reboot</strong><br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    This command will reboot the computer every monday at 07:00 am. Save the
    crontab - file with the keyboard command <strong>ctrl + o</strong>, then
    press enter to accept the filename. Now that text is saved, exit the editor
    with the keyboard command <strong>ctrl + x</strong>. The crontab comes into
    effect immediately, no need to reboot.<br>
    <br>
    The fields in the crontab commandline mean (from left to right):<br>

    <h2><a id="Cloning a FreeLCS installation to another machine (without a display)">Cloning
        a FreeLCS installation to another machine (without a display)</a></h2>
    The 2.3 release of FreeLCS introduces a tool that can be used to backup and
    restore a FreeLCS installation. This functionality can be used to clone a
    installation to any number of Ubuntu machines. Neither the backup nor the
    restore scripts requires a graphical desktop and both can be run over a ssh
    - connection on a 'headless machine' .<br>
    <br>
    This functionality is targeted at advanced users who know their way around
    Linux and the Terminal. The backup script can be found in directory '<strong>Backup_FreeLCS_configuration</strong>'
    of the FreeLCS installer zip.<br>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Install FreeLCS with the normal graphical installer and adjust
        settings the way you want.</li>
      <li>Then run '<strong>00-backup_freelcs_configuration.sh</strong>' to make
        a backup of the installation settings. Files needed for restoration and
        a restoration script will be created in directory '<strong>freelcs_backup</strong>'.</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of dir '<strong>freelcs_backup</strong>' to all
        machines that you want to have the same configuration and run the
        restoration script '<strong>00-restore_freelcs_configuration.sh</strong>'
        on each. </li>
      <li>The restoration script will install all programs and scripts that
        FreeLCS needs to function. After restoration all machines will have
        identical FreeLCS installation. </li>
      <li>Reboot the machines or start loudness correction scripts manually
        (restoration script displays the startup command at the end of the run).<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Result: The FreeLCS installation has been cloned to several machines.<br>
    <br>
    Note: Internet connection is required during restoration, since all needed
    programs are downloaded and installed from the net<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="How to report a bug">How to report a bug</a></h2>
    If you have found an error in FreeLCS software or documentation please
    report it so that it can be corrected.<br>
    <br>
    If you find that FreeLCS software crashes or behaves in ways it should not,
    try first to find out if the problem is caused by a file in the HotFolder.
    If a certain file or file format causes the problem please make a copy of
    the file / files for later use. The files might be needed to confirm that
    the bugfix really solves the problem.<br>
    <br>
    When you file a bugreport keep in mind that the developer needs to be able
    to reproduce the bug in his own system in order to fix it. So when reporting
    a bug report the following:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The operating system version that you use (Ubuntu 12.04 32bit or 64
        bit)</li>
      <li>The version of the FreeLCS - package that you use.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The steps that needs to be done in order to make the bug appear.</li>
      <li>If a file causes the bug and you want to send the file to the
        developer, then store the file in a cloud file storage system for
        example DropBox's Public - folder and add the download link to the bug
        report.</li>
      <li>Error messages are good sources for information when hunting a bug, so
        if you get one please add it to the bug report.</li>
      <li>If a program just stops working, then it has crashed. In most cases
        the program is not able to show any error message to the user because
        the program runs in the background. An error message holds valuable
        information about what went wrong and if you want to help to sort out
        the cause of the error you can run the program manually in Terminal.
        When a program is run manually in Terminal the user can see all possible
        error messages. <a href="#Run%20FreeLCS%20programs%20so%20that%20possible%20error%20messages%20can%20be%20seen">Click

    <h2><a id="Run FreeLCS programs so that possible error messages can be seen">Run
        FreeLCS programs so that possible error messages can be seen</a></h2>
    <h3>LoudnessCorrection.py</h3>
    <br>
    LoudnessCorrection.py is the program that is responsible for processing the
    files that appear in the HotFolder. Normally LoudnessCorrection.py runs in
    the background and has no way to display error messages to the user. The
    program can however be manually started in the Terminal.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the Terminal and stop all FreeLCS programs with the command (asks
        for root password): <strong>sudo
          /etc/init.d/loudnesscorrection_init_script stop</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now there are two ways to run LoudnessCorrection.py, the first one
      discards all settings user defined in the installer and runs with default
      settings. When you run the program in this mode you need to add the full
      path to the target directory at the end of the command. The target
      directory is the directory which has Hotfolder "<strong>LoudnessCorrection</strong>"
      inside it. Note that running the program like this the language defaults
      to english meaning the program expects the HotFolder name to be "<strong>LoudnessCorrection</strong>".</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Run the program with default settings: <strong>/usr/bin/LoudnessCorrection.py
          /mountpoint/</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that when running in this mode the program outputs a lot of text, it
      tells all the time what it is doing.<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>The second way to run LoudnessCorrection.py is to use the settings that
      user defined in the installer. The settings are stored in file <strong>/etc/Loudness_Correction_Settings.pickle</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Run the program with user defined settings: <strong>/usr/bin/LoudnessCorrection.py
          -configfile /etc/Loudness_Correction_Settings.pickle</strong><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freelcs/tickets/"></a> <br>
    When running in this mode there will be no output unless the program
    crashes. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>HeartBeat_Checker.py</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have not already done so open the Terminal and stop all FreeLCS
        programs (asks for root password): <strong>sudo
          /etc/init.d/loudnesscorrection_init_script stop</strong><br>
      </li>
      <li>Run HeartBeat_Checker manually in Terminal: <strong>/usr/bin/HeartBeat_Checker.py
          -configfile /etc/Loudness_Correction_Settings.pickle</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    HeartBeat_Checker does not display anything unless it crashes.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Installer.py</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Open Terminal and navigate to the directory where installer.py is
        located.</li>
      <li>Make installer executable with this command: <strong>chmod 755
          installer.py</strong></li>

    <h3>Typical Python error message</h3>
    If a program crashes then the Python3 interpreter displays an error message
    telling what went wrong. A typical Python error message looks like this:<br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    If you get a message like this please copy it to the bug report. This
    message is valuable since it tells the developer exactly on which line of
    the program code the error happened.<br>
    <br>
    To copy text from the Terminal first select the text to be copied and then
    copy it with the keyboard command: <strong>shift + ctrl + c</strong><br>
    <br>
    Paste the text to the bug report.<br>

    <h2><a id="FreeLCS development">FreeLCS development</a></h2>
    FreeLCS development happens on Github ( <a href="https://github.com/mhartzel/freelcs">https://github.com/mhartzel/freelcs</a>).
    All new versions of software are uploaded there before official release.
    Unreleased versions are untested so it is recommended that normal users do
    not use these versions on their production servers. The reason for this is
    that when new program code is added and old is modified it is possible that
    new bugs creep in.<br>
    <br>
    If however you have encountered a bug you can navigate to that webpage and
    check the changelog there (Documentation/Changelog.txt) to see if the bug
    has already been fixed. If you want to test the latest software versions you
    can download all files in the git-repository like this:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the Terminal and get root - permissions (asks for root password):
        <strong>sudo su</strong><br>
      </li>
      <li>Install git - software: <strong>apt-get -y install git</strong><br>
      </li>
      <li>Navigate to the directory where you want to Download the latest
        FreeLCS files.</li>
      <li>Download the git-repository with the command: <strong>git clone
          http://github.com/mhartzel/freelcs.git</strong><br>
      </li>
      <li>This will create a new directory 'freelcs' and put all files inside
        it.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
