    <h2> <a id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
    FreeLCS stands for <strong>Free Loudness Correction Server</strong>.
    FreeLCS lets you automatically correct audio files to EBU R128 target
    loudness level.<br>
    <br>
    The software lets you easily set up a server that shares one of it's folders
    to the network. Users of your network can then drop audio files to the
    server for automatic loudness correction. For each processed file the server
    also creates a loudness history graphics file which shows loudness
    variations inside the file.<br>
    <br>
    The software is very fast even on modest hardware giving 15 times faster
    than realtime processing (16 bit stereo files, TruePeak measurement turned
    on) on a server with one Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4 GB Ram, 3 internal
    Sata disks in software RAID 0. <br>
    <br>
    FreeLCS uses other open source programs to get the job done (Linux,
    libebur128, gnuplot, FFmpeg, sox, mediainfo). All software is free and Open
    Source.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> <a id="Features">Features</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Automatically loudness corrects audio files to conform with EBU R128
        loudness recommendation.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, just drop in your file and copy back the loudness
        corrected version.</li>
      <li>Creates loudness history graphics that allows the user to see how
        loudness varies inside a file (example picture below).</li>
      <li>Supports channel counts from mono to 5.1.</li>
      <li>Supports EBU TruePeak measurement.</li>
      <li>Uses a protective TruePeak lookahead limiter to keep peaks in the
        allowed range where needed.</li>
      <li>Takes advantage of multiple processor cores to run calculations
        simultaneously.</li>
      <li>User is able to define how many audio files are processed at the same
        time, limited only by available cpu processing power and hard disk
        bandwidth.</li>
      <li>Supports writing loudness measurement results to a machine readable
        file.</li>
      <li>Modest hardware requirements, runs fine with only 4 GB of ram.</li>
      <li>Can be run inside a virtual machine, no need for physical hardware.</li>
      <li>Fast processing. On typical hardware you can expect processing to be
        10 - 20 faster than realtime.</li>

      <ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Remix audio from MXF files to required mixes before loudness
        processing.</li>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <li>All software is free and Open Source. Install in as many computers as
        you like.</li>
      <li>Runs on the free Linux operating system, no need to pay for
        proprietary os installation.</li>
      <li>Easy to integrate in many workflows.</li>
      <li>Written in Python 3.</li>

    <h2> <a id="Installation">Installation</a></h2>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    FreeLCS installation requires either a connection to the internet or access
    to a local Debian / Ubuntu package repository.<br>
    <br>
    The installation instructions below apply to <strong>Ubuntu Desktop</strong>.
    This is the most user friendly of the supported operating systems.
    Installation on other supported platforms differs from the instructions
    below.<br>
    <br>
    If you use <strong>Ubuntu Server</strong> (Ubuntu version without any
    graphical user interface) then the <a href="Ubuntu_Server_modifications_needed_before_FreeLCS_installation.html">installation
      procedure is described here</a>.<br>
    <br>
    If you use <strong>Debian Desktop</strong> (with a graphical user
    interface), then you first need to <a href="Debian_modifications_needed_before_FreeLCS_installation.html">make
      some modifications to the Debian system</a> and then you can follow
    installation instructions for Ubuntu Desktop below. Things that needs to be
    done differently on Debian are pointed out in the instructions.<br>
    <br>
    <p><strong></strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Always use a 64 bit Linux distro. FreeLCS uses external helper
        programs and one of those (mediainfo) in it's 32 bit version is not able
        to handle big audio files. The 64 bit version of mediainfo works fine
        with big files.</li>
      <li>A good starting point for a company server running in a virtual
        machine might be assigning 4 GB of ram and 6 processor cores for the
        virtual machine running FreeLCS. All cores will only be used when there
        are 3 files to process simultaneously. When FreeLCS virtual server is
        idle, the cores are available to other virtual machines running on the
        same hardware.</li>
      <li>It is recommended to use <strong>Ext4</strong> or <strong>XFS</strong>
        filesystems for all disks. These are now very stable and much faster
        than the JFS filesystem I used to recommend earlier.</li>
      <li>During the installation of Ubuntu and Debian, you are prompted to
        create the first user. It is important to use a password for this
        account, do not leave the password empty.</li>
      <li>After installation of Ubuntu, log in as the first user you created
        during installation. (<strong>Debian</strong>: log in as the non root
        user you created during installation (the second user you created)).</li>
      <li>Next you must install <strong>python3</strong> and <strong>idle3</strong>
        giving a terminal command.</li>
      <li>Press the "windows" key on the keyboard to bring up Ubuntu search
        function, write: <strong>term</strong><br>
        You should now see an icon for "Terminal", start it up by clicking on
        it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>

    <p><img alt="" src="Pictures/Terminal-01.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write the following commands in the terminal window (you can copy and
        paste them from below. Note that that keyboard command for paste in
        Terminal is: <strong>shift + ctrl + v</strong>):</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>sudo apt-get update</strong><br>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>sudo apt-get -y install python3 idle3<br>

    </blockquote>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Press enter after each line to run the commands.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
      <strong></strong></p>
    <p><img alt="" src="Pictures/Terminal-02.jpg"><br>

    <p><strong><br>
      </strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote> </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>The first command will ask for your password. Type it in and press
        enter.</li>
      <li>The first command-line (<strong>apt-get update</strong>) fetches up to
        date information about what software package versions are available for
        installation. If the package information is out of date then FreeLCS
        installation may fail. The second line installs python3 programming
        language.</li>
      <li>Now that python3 is installed you can start the FreeLCS installation
        program. The installer will ask you some details about how you would
        like the loudness correction server to work and installs the rest of the
        programs FreeLCS needs.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Next unzip the FreeLCS - package by clicking it with the right mouse
        button and selecting " <strong>Extract Here</strong>". A new directory
        will be created and all FreeLCS files will be unzipped there.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Installation-00.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Next we need to make the installer program executable. Navigate to the
        directory that unzip created and right click the "<strong>installer.py</strong>"
        program and select "<strong>Properties</strong>" from the menu.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <img src="Pictures/Installation-01.jpg"><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Click the "<strong>Permissions</strong>" tab and select "<strong>Allow
          executing file as program</strong>" and the click "<strong>Close</strong>".
        The installer program can now be run.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Installation-02.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Double click the "<strong>installer.py</strong>" - file. A window will
        appear, click "<strong>Run</strong>".<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Installation-02-2.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>If the installer program opens up in a text editor instead of showing you
      the window above, then the file manager you are using prevents the program
      from running. This happens at least on <strong>Ubuntu 14.04</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If this happens then you need to change a setting in your file
        manager. First open up it's preferences.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>The next screen will ask some details about how you would like
        loudness correction to work.</li>
      <li>The first section will allow you to define the path to the target
        directory. Some directories are automatically created inside this target
        directory, the most important of these is the '<strong>HotFolder</strong>'.
        HotFolder is the folder where users can drop in files for processing.
        HotFolder is by default located in: '<strong>Target Directory /
          LoudnessCorrection</strong>'. Hotfolder name depends on your selected
        target loudness, this if further discussed below.</li>
      <li>The second section allows you to select English or Finnish as the
        language for directories and text in loudness history graphics files.</li>
      <li>'<strong>Number of processor cores to use</strong>' lets you define
        how many processor cores are used in loudness calculation and file
        processing. When a file is being processed it always ties up two
        processor cores. The speed of processing is most often dependent of the
        raw speed of disks. If your HotFolder is on an fast disk for example a
        Raid device, then it often speeds up processing if you select here more
        processor cores than you actually have. For example for our test server
        that has one Intel Core 2 Duo (dual core) processor, 4 GB of Ram, 3 x 1
        TB Sata - disks in Raid 0 for HotFolder, the sweet spot for speed is six
        cores even though we only have two. See: <a href="#%20Optimizing%20processing%20speed">Optimizing
          processing speed.</a><br>
      </li>
      <li>The next section of the window lets you define the time files are
        allowed to stay on the server before they are automatically deleted. The
        default value here is 8 hours (480 minutes).</li>
      <li>The last section lets you define the target loudness level. Files
        processed with FreeLCS will be at this loudness level. EBU R128 standard
        target loudness is -23 LUFS and the installer defaults to this value. If
        you tick the box on this section you can change target loudness in range
        of <strong>-31 LUFS to -12 LUFS</strong>. Note that using high target
        loudness levels puts some additional requirements for the source files,
        these must be mixed with reduced loudness range or you might introduce
        limiting. <a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#Considerations%20for%20using%20a%20target%20loudness%20higher%20than%20-23%20LUFS"
          title="Considerations for using a target loudness higher than -23 LUFS">This
          is further discussed here</a>. Hotfolder name will be just "<strong>LoudnessCorrection</strong>"
        when using EBU target level -23 LUFS, but if you change it then the
        target level is added to the hotfolder name, for example "<strong>LoudnessCorrection_-16_LUFS</strong>".
        Hotfolder name is part of the mount command and this will help users to
        see which target level service they are using in case you have one
        instance processing files with -23 LUFS and another instance processing
        with -16 LUFS.</li>

        the hotfolder name, for example "<strong>LoudnessCorrection_-16_LUFS</strong>".
        Hotfolder name is part of the mount command and this will help users to
        see which target level service they are using in case you have one
        instance processing files with -23 LUFS and another instance processing
        with -16 LUFS.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>The next window lets you select if you want "<a href="#Html%20Progress%20report"><strong>Html
            progress report</strong></a>" written to the HotFolder. It is an
        html-page that can be viewed with a web-browser and it displays the
        loudness calculation queue inside the server. On the page you can see
        how many files are waiting to be processed and names of the last 100
        processed files and times they were processed. The "<strong>html
          progress report</strong>" is a tool for the admin to see what's going
        on inside the server, this feature is not needed by normal users.
        Current time is displayed on the page also and if it is advancing then
        the server is alive and well :) The default path for the "Html progress
        report" is "<strong>Target Directory / LoudnessCorrection /
          00-Calculation_Queue_Information /
          00-Calculation_Queue_Information.html</strong>".<br>
      </li>
      <li>The "Html progress report" is updated once in every 5 seconds. During
        heavy file processing the physical harddisk can become so busy that the
        progress report can't be written to it often enough. When this happens
        the progress report seems to be frozen. This problem can be solved by
        creating a ram-disk and writing the "Html progress report" there instead
        of the physical hard disk. Ram-disks can be written and read very
        quickly and traffic jams on hard disks don't affect them at all.</li>
      <li>If you wan't the progress report to be written on a ram-disk, then you
        can select which of the operating systems ram-devices are used to create
        the ram disk. You need to change the default setting of "<strong>/dev/ram1</strong>"
        here only if you know you have created other ram-disks for other
        purposes and you know that device "/dev/ram1" is already used for
        something else.</li>
      <li>Then you can select which user account is used when loudness
        correction and heartbeat checker programs are run. These two programs
        are always run as an "unprivileged" user. If you only created one user,
        then this user is used by default.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If you are not sure what to select for options described above, then
        just leave the defaults as they are. Defaults are ok for most users :)</li>
      <li>The last option on this window lets you select which peak measurement
        method you want to use: <strong>sample peak</strong> or <strong>TruePeak</strong>.
        TruePeak is a method that tries to find invisible peaks that might exist
        between audio samples. These peaks can go above the maximum allowed 0
        dBFS and cause distortion when the digital signal is converted back to
        analog. TruePeak measurement calculates new samples in between existing
        audio samples and finds these hidden peaks. EBU R128 recommends always
        using TruePeak method to measure audio peaks. TruePeak calculation is
        about four time slower than finding the highest existing audio sample in
        a file.<br>
      </li>
      <li>FreeLCS uses TruePeak peak limiting in cases where loudness is below
        -23 LUFS and peaks are so high that distortion would be introduced when
        file loudness is adjusted up.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The next window will allow you to define how FreeLCS ouputs its
        results. Most users will use the defaults meaning FreeLCS creates
        loudness corrected audio files, history graphics files and deletes
        multistream files immediately after audiostreams have been extracted
        from them. This is how FreeLCS versions up to 2.4 worked by default. If
        you want FreeLCS to work just like it did in versions up to 2.4, then
        make sure "<strong>Use FreeLCS file output defaults</strong>" is "<strong>Yes</strong>"
        and go to the next screen.</li>
      <li>If you however would like to integrate FreeLCS as a loudness
        measurement step in your automated file processing workflow, then you
        might want to change the defaults. FreeLCS 3.0 is able to output
        loudness measurement results in a machine readable file. <a href="Machine_readable_results_and_MXF_audio_remix_mapping.html#Machine_readable_results">Read

      <li>Starting from FreeLCS 3.0 it is possible to restrict FFmpeg to only
        process a small set of formats or allow it to process all formats it
        supports. This feature is mainly designed to allow the user to restrict
        processing only to patent free formats. Format patentability varies from
        country to country, see more about it in <a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#Libav-tools%20/%20FFmpeg%20and%20patents">FAQ</a>.</li>

    <h2><a id="Files that FreeLCS creates in your system">Files that FreeLCS
        creates on your system</a></h2>
    FreeLCS writes some files onto your disk. In addition to installing some
    programs FreeLCS needs to do it's job, it also writes files that start up
    FreeLCS every time the computer starts.<br>
    <h3>Installed programs:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mediainfo</li>
      <li>Sox</li>
      <li>Gnuplot</li>
      <li>samba</li>
      <li>Libebur128</li>
    </ul>
    If you want to uninstall FreeLCS you can remove these programs with the
    following terminal command:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>sudo apt-get remove mediainfo sox gnuplot samba<br>
    </strong><br>
    FreeLCS needs sox 14.4.0 and if you are running an older os version (Ubuntu
    12.04), then the sox version available in os package repositories is older
    than 14.4.0. In this case FreeLCS installer compiles sox 14.4.0 from source
    code. Libebur128 is always compiled from source.<br>
    <br>
    You can find out where the compiled programs are installed with the
    following terminal commands:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>which loudness<br>
      which sox</strong><br>
    <br>
    You can remove these programs with these commands (replace the
    "path_to_command" with the output from the "which" command above):<br>
    <br>
    <strong>sudo rm path_to_command</strong><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    FreeLCS needs to start every time the computer starts up, so some start up
    scripts are created on your system.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Files created on a systemd based os (Debian 8, Ubuntu 16.04 and newer):</h2>
    <strong>/usr/bin/LoudnessCorrection.py<br>

      <br>
      /usr/bin/loudness-freelcs<br>
      <br>
    </strong>Some file installation paths depend on the distribution, you can
    find these files with the command:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>find /usr/lib/ -name "*freelcs*"<br>
    </strong> <br>
    The text "<strong>brd</strong>" is added to <strong>/etc/modules</strong>
    if it is not already there and the brd module is not built into the kernel.
    Brd is a ram disk driver.<br>
    <br>
    If you want to remove FreeLCS then stop FreeLCS and delete the files listed
    above with these terminal commands:<br>
    <br>
    <strong>systemctl stop freelcs.service<br>
      systemctl disable freelsc.service<br>

    <h2>Explanation of FreeLCS startup files:</h2>
    <strong>/usr/bin/LoudnessCorrection.py</strong><br>
    <ul>
      <li> This is the main program of FreeLCS. It responsible for processing
        all audio files.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong> <a id="HeartBeat_Checker_Explained" name="HeartBeat_Checker_Explained"></a>/usr/bin/HeartBeat_Checker.py</strong><br>
    <ul>
      <li> HeartBeat Checker monitors the health of the LoudnessCorrection.py -
        program and sends email to the admin if LoudnessCorrection.py crashes.
        This program is started only if you enabled it in the installer. </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>/etc/LoudnessCorrection_Settings.pickle<br>
    </strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The settings that you defined when running the FreeLCS installer are
        stored in this file. LoudnessCorrection.py and HeartBeat_Checker.py both
        read their settings from this file when they start up.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong></strong><strong>/etc/systemd/system/loudnesscorrection_init_script</strong><br>
    <ul>
      <li> This script is resposible for first setting up things FreeLCS needs
        and then starting up FreeLCS. When this program starts it first creates
        a ram disk, then creates directories in the HotFolder and sets their
        permissions correctly. Then it starts up LoudnessCorrection.py and
        HeartBeat_Checker.py - programs.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>/etc/systemd/system/freelcs.service</strong><br>
    <ul>
      <li>This file describes what systemd needs to do to start up FreeLCS and
        what services needs to be up before starting it. Based on this
        information systemd starts: <strong>/etc/systemd/system/loudnesscorrection_init_script</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <strong>/etc/samba/smb.conf</strong><br>
    <ul>
      <li> This is the configuration file for the samba server that shares the
        FreeLCS HotFolder to the network. Hotfolder is shared to the network
        only if you selected "<strong>Share HotFolder to the network with samba</strong>"&nbsp;
        =&nbsp; "<strong>yes</strong>" in the installer.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> <a id="Usage">Usage</a></h2>
    FreeLCS usage is very simple.
    <ol>
      <li>First you mount FreeLCS HotFolder through the network. </li>
      <li>Then you drag some files to the HotFolder .</li>
      <li>A couple of minutes later you can drag loudness corrected files back
        from "<strong>HotFolder / 00-Corrected_Files</strong>" to your computer
        .</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    Mounting of the HotFolder is explained in it's own chapter.<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>When you mount the HotFolder your operating system automatically opens
        a window that shows the contents of the HotFolder. The examples below
        are from Mac OS X, but the same principles apply to all operating
        systems.</li>
      <li>The root of HotFolder is where you drag files you want to be loudness
        corrected.</li>
      <li>Inside the root - folder there are two other folders: "<strong>00-Corrected_Files</strong>"
        is where corrected files and loudness calculation history graphics
        appear. The folder "<strong>00-Calculation_Queue_Information</strong>"
        is used to store two files that normally aren't of interest to normal
        users. The first one is "<strong>00-Calculation_Queue_Information.html</strong>".
        That is an html-file that can be opened in a web-browser. The page is
        updated every 5 seconds and it shows how many files are waiting to be
        processed, which files are currently worked upon and so on. The second
        file that is stored in this folder is "<strong>00-HeartBeat.pickle</strong>".
        LoudnessCorrection writes periodically timestamps and other information
        in this file and HeartBeat_Checker.py monitors this file. If information
        in the file stops updating then LoudnessCorrection has crashed and
        HeartBeat_Checker sends email to the admin.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Usage-01.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>For normal users the only folders of interest are the root of the
        HotFolder and the "<strong>HotFolder / 00-Corrected_Files</strong>".</li>
      <li>To process a file drag it in the root of the HotFolder.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Usage-02.jpg"><br>

    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Usage-03.jpg"><br>

    </p>
    <p><img src="Pictures/Usage-04.jpg"><br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In a while files start to appear there. The first file will be the
        loudness calculation history graphics file and some time after that the
        loudness corrected sound file appears. Drag the corrected sound files
        back to your computer. Each corrected file will have the string&nbsp; "<strong>_-23_LUFS</strong>"
        added at the end of its name.</li>
      <li>All files in the root of the "<strong>HotFolder</strong>" and&nbsp; "<strong>00-Corrected_Files</strong>"
        will be automatically deleted after a time period that you defined in
        the installer program. By default it is 8 hours.<br>

      <li>Note !!!!!!! There are connection problems on OS X 10.7 - 10.10 due to
        Apple's broken smb - implementation. <a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#Errors_copying_files_from_OS_X_10.7-10.10_to_FreeLCS-Server">Read
          more about it here</a>.</li>
      <li>First click an empty spot on your desktop, this activates the Finder -
        program.</li>
      <li>The keyboard shortcut to bring up the "Connect to Server" - window is
        <strong>cmd + k</strong>, so keep the cmd pressed and press k.</li>
      <li>Now you need to have your servers ip-address. Write "<strong>smb://your
          servers ip address</strong>" in the prompt and press "Connect".<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <li>The next window lets you choose between logging in anonymously or as a
        registered user. The network share on the FreeLCS - server is configured
        to accept only anonymous logins. So don't write in any username or
        password, just click "<strong>Guest</strong>".<br>

    <p>When you have mounted the HotFolder you can make an alias for it that
      stays on your desktop. You can then skip all the steps above and mount the
      HotFolder just by double clicking on the alias.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First you must have mounted the HotFolder.</li>
      <li>Open a Finder - window and scroll to the bottom of the device list on
        the left panel. You should see an entry there that has the name of your
        computer, by default it is "admin's Mac". Click on it.</li>
      <li>Now you should see all mounted devices in the Finder window and "<strong>LoudnessCorrection</strong>"
        should be among them. Start dragging "LoudnessCorrection" out of the
        finder window to the desktop and before you let go of the mouse button
        press and hold <strong>cmd</strong> and <strong>alt</strong> -
        buttons. You should see a curved arrow on top of the LoudnessCorrection
        - icon. Keep pressing cmd and alt and let go of the mouse button.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Now on your desktop there should be a "LoudnessCorrection" - icon with
        a curved arrow on top of it. An icon like this is called an alias.<br>
      </li>
      <li>From now on you can mount the LoudnessCorrection HotFolder just by

    <br>
    The upper part of the window shows the names of next 10 first files that are

    <h2><a id=" Optimizing processing speed"> Optimizing processing speed</a></h2>
    If you have a fast enough processor, for example 1 x Intel Core 2 Duo, then
    the processor is able to process files much quicker than a single hard disk
    is able to serve it. When multiple files are processed at the same time,
    there will be lots of reading and writing going on and the speed of the disk
    becomes the bottleneck of the system. You can get more speed out of you
    system by setting up three disks in a raid 0 array and putting the HotFolder
    onto the raid.<br>
    <br>
    An alternative to software raid and multiple rotating disks is to use a
    single Solid State Disk (SSD) as the HotFolder disk. SSD - disks are very
    fast, but they have one disadvantage over traditional rotating disks. SSD -
    disks wear out much more quickly than traditional disk. Modern SSDs have
    hardware that tries to even out the wear that writing causes to SSD memory
    cells. A typical SSD has a life span that is roughly equal to a rotating
    disk when the SSD is in an environment that corresponds to typical desktop
    usage. If your FreeLCS - server processes lots of audio files all the time,
    then the SSD - disk is going to wear out sooner than expected. SSD might be
    a good solution if you buy two disks and keep the other as spare.<br>
    <br>
    Another thing that affects processing speed is the setting "<strong>Number
      Of Processor Cores To Use</strong>" in the installer. Each file that is
    processed ties up two processor cores, but if you have a fast disk and a
    hyper-threading capable processor, you might get more speed by setting the "<strong>Number
      Of Processor Cores To Use</strong>" to a bigger number than you have
    actual physical processor cores.<br>
    <br>
    After you have set up raid you can find the sweet spot of your system by
    doing a simple test.<br>
    <br>
    First collect a bunch of typical files that the server is going to process
    when doing real work. The total size of the files should at minimum be
    double the size of ram you have on your server, but more files is better.
    Save the files on the server, but don't put them in the HotFolder yet.<br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li>Delete all files from the HotFolder.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Run the FreeLCS installer and set the "<strong>Number Of Processor
          Cores To Use</strong>" to the number of physical processor cores you
        have and reboot.</li>
      <li>Wait for FreeLCS to start up.</li>
      <li>Open the html-progress report in your web-browser and see that the
        time displayed on the page is advancing. If not then LoudnessCorrection
        is not running yet.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Now you need to make the test files appear in the HotFolder. The
        quickest way to make this happen is to create hard links for the test
        files in the HotFolder. This makes the files appear immediately without
        making physical copies of the files.<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote><strong>date&nbsp; ;&nbsp; ln&nbsp;&nbsp;
          /path_to_test_files/*&nbsp;&nbsp; /path_to_hotfolder/</strong></blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ol>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li>This command displays the current time which also is the time files
        were linked to the HotFolder, take note of the time.</li>
      <li>Wait for processing to finish and take a look at the html-progress
        report and see the time the last files processing finished.</li>
      <li>Calculate the time it took.</li>
      <li>Repeat the process from step 1, but add two to the "<strong>Number Of
          Processor Cores To Use</strong>" in the installer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You should find the fastest processing time in 2 - 4 rounds of the test.</p>
    <p><br>
      Our test servers sweet spot is to use six cores even though there is only
      two physical processor cores. Our test server specs are:<br>
      <br>
      1 x Intel Core 2 Duo Processor<br>
      2 GB Ram<br>
      1 TB hard disk for Ubuntu<br>
      3 x 1 TB hard disks in a software raid 0 array for the "HotFolder".<br>
      1 Gbit Ethernet</p>
    <br>
    The speed test results for our test server were:<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Use 2 Cores: 20 minutes 11 seconds</li>
      <li>Use 4 Cores: 14 minutes 10 seconds</li>
      <li>Use 6 Cores: 13 minutes 09 seconds</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>With more than 6 cores the processing time started to increase rapidly.<br>
    </p>

    <h2> <a id="Configuring software Raid">Configuring software Raid</a></h2>
    Linux software raid configuration is a bit out of the scope of this
    document.&nbsp; Here are the steps that were required to get our server's
    raid set up. The steps I followed were mostly from here: <a href="http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch26_:_Linux_Software_RAID">http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch26_:_Linux_Software_RAID</a><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Warning !!!!!!!&nbsp; Linux knowledge is required here. If you are not
    careful these commands can mess up your system&nbsp; :)<br>
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Install 3 Sata disks in the computer. Ubuntu gave our disks
        device-names: <strong>sdb, sdc , sdd.<br>
        </strong></li>
      <li>Get root-permission with the command: <strong>sudo su</strong><br>
      </li>
      <li>Partition each disk as type: <strong>Primary</strong>, &nbsp; <strong>fd
          (Linux raid autodetect)</strong>. If your disks are bigger than 2 TB
        then <a href="#How_to_partition_disks_bigger_than_2_TB_on_Linux">see
          here how to partition them.</a></li>
      <li>Install Linux raid software: <strong>apt-get install mdadm</strong></li>
      <li>Create a raid 0 device from the three disks: <strong>mdadm --verbose
          --create /dev/md0 --level=0 --raid-devices=3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1
          /dev/sdd1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>(Warning:
        don't give this command on an existing raid, this will wipe out the raid
        partition table clearing out all data on the disks)<strong><br>
        </strong></li>
      <li>If mdadm complains that: "Device Or Resource Busy", then mdadm may
        already be using some of the disks and you need to tell it not to. The
        command: <strong>cat /proc/mdstat</strong>&nbsp; lists currently
        existing raid-devices, stop them with the command (device name is md127
        in the example, check the real device name from the output of: cat
        /proc/mdstat): <strong>mdadm --stop /dev/md127</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        now try creating the raid-device again with the command on the previous
        line.</li>
      <li>When raid-device creation succeeds without error messages, format the
        raid device with <strong>Ext4</strong> or <strong>XFS</strong>
        filesystem (in this example we use ext4): <strong>mkfs.ext4
          /dev/md0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>(Warning: this
        will wipe out all data on the disks)<strong><br>
        </strong></li>
      <li>Now the raid device exists, but Linux forgets about it in the next
        boot unless we tell it to configure it again when booting up. The next
        commands will save the configuration:</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>cd /etc/mdadm</strong></p>
        <p><strong>mv mdadm.conf mdadm.conf.orig</strong></p>
        <p><strong>echo "DEVICE partitions" &gt; /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</strong></p>
        <p><strong>mdadm --detail --scan &gt;&gt; /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Next make a directory for mounting the raid:<strong> mkdir&nbsp;
          -p&nbsp; /mountpoint/raid-disk</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and make it
        readable and writable for everyone:<strong> chmod -R 777 &nbsp;</strong><strong>
          /mountpoint</strong></li>
      <li>Get the <strong>Universally Unique IDentifier</strong> (UUID) for the
        raid disk with command: <strong>blkid /dev/md0</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp; &nbsp; the command will show output like below:<strong></strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>/dev/</strong><strong>md0</strong><strong>:
        UUID="229f0670-c8c2-4145-b2f4-b1100d9cb918" TYPE="ext4"</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add the device to your <strong>/etc/fstab</strong> so that it gets
        automatically mounted next time the computer starts up. It is important
        to use the <strong>UUID</strong> instead of the device name (/dev/md0)
        to identify your raid disk in fstab. When the kernel gets updated then
        your raid device number may change (for example from: <strong>/dev/md0</strong>&nbsp;
        to&nbsp; <strong>/dev/md127</strong>) and if you used the device name +
        number in fstab then the disk won't mount anymore. The UUID of a device
        will not change and it can be used to identify the disk instead of its

        partition disks bigger than 2 TB on Linux</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you use hard disks bigger than 2 TB, then the disks must be
        partitioned using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table">GPT</a>
        format. Use <strong>parted</strong> to create GPT partitions on the
        disks. The easiest way is to install and use the graphical version of

      <li>The commandline procedure to use the text based <strong>parted</strong>
        to create a partition spanning the whole disk <strong>/dev/sdb</strong>
        and setting the partition type to Raid is:</li>

    <h2> <a id="Notes on loudness correction usage">Notes on loudness
        correction usage</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Never process audio channels from the same mix separately from each
        other. Processing left and right channels of a stereo mix separately
        results in loudness being 3 dBs too high. All audio channels of a mix
        must be in the same file or audiostream of a file.</li>
      <li>Silence does not affect loudness calculation. You can cut off silence
        after loudness correction without affecting the integrated loudness of a
        file.<br>
      </li>
      <li>It might sometimes be useful to 'normalize' raw material early in the
        video editing phase of a project. You might have a project that is made
        up of several independent parts that need to be loudness corrected
        separately. An example of this might be a program where a studio host
        talks and plays cartoons for kids. The studio sections of the program
        and each cartoon will have different loudness characteristics.&nbsp;
        After you have loudness corrected each section separately there might
        not be any need for audio post production anymore.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Loudness correction does not affect internal dynamics of a file. If
        you have too wide loudness variations in a file they will be there also
        after loudness correction. Correction only adjusts the 'main level' of a
        file. If integrated loudness of a file is -19 LUFS, loudness correction
        will make all parts of the file 4 dBs quieter and relative loudness
        variations inside the file will remain the same. This is how EBU R128 is
        designed to work, you can still have loud and soft parts in your mix,
        but it is your responsibility to use them wisely :)<br>

        Below there are instructions for both of these methods.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Automatic weekly reboot with Crontab</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cron </strong>can be used to run commands at preset times.
        The configuration for Cron is called <strong>Crontab</strong>. It is a
        simple text file and we add our commands to it using a text editor.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Open a terminal an write in the command: (asks for root password):</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>sudo crontab -e</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Ubuntu will prompt:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p><b><i>no crontab for root - using an empty one<br>
              <br>
              Select an editor.&nbsp; To change later, run 'select-editor'.</i>
            <i><br>

              Choose 1-4 [2]:</i></b> </p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This means that Ubuntu wants to know which text based text editor you
      would like to use to edit the crontab - file, press "2". This will select
      the "nano" - text editor.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Now the text editor opens up in Terminal and shows some text that Ubuntu
      automatically inserted into the crontab, navigate to the bottom of it and
      add the following line:<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote><strong>00 07 * * 1 /sbin/reboot</strong><br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    This command will reboot the computer every monday at 07:00 am. Save the
    crontab - file with the keyboard command <strong>ctrl + o</strong>, then
    press enter to accept the filename. Now that text is saved, exit the editor
    with the keyboard command <strong>ctrl + x</strong>. The crontab comes into
    effect immediately, no need to reboot.<br>
    <br>
    The fields in the crontab commandline mean (from left to right):<br>
    <br>
    <u><strong>Field</strong></u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    The last field is the full path to the command we want Cron to run.<br>
    <br>
    <h2>Automatic weekly reboot with systemd</h2>

    what to do (reboot) and when (weekly at a specific time).<br>
    <br>
    First create the file "<strong>reboot_weekly.service</strong>" that
    instructs systemd what to do (reboot). Startup the nano - editor to create
    the file with the command:<br>

    <h2><a id="Cloning a FreeLCS installation to another machine (without a display)">Cloning
        a FreeLCS installation to another machine (without a display)</a></h2>
    The 2.3 release of FreeLCS introduces a tool that can be used to backup and
    restore a FreeLCS installation. This functionality can be used to clone a
    installation to any number of machines. Neither the backup nor the restore
    scripts requires a graphical desktop and both can be run over a ssh -
    connection on a 'headless machine' .<br>
    <br>
    This functionality is targeted at advanced users who know their way around
    Linux and the Terminal.<br>
    <br>
    Note: the backup script can be found in FreeLCS <strong>zip</strong> - file
    in location: '<strong>Backup_FreeLCS_configuration / </strong><strong>00-backup_freelcs_configuration.sh</strong>'.<br>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Install FreeLCS with the normal graphical installer and adjust
        settings the way you want.</li>
      <li>Then run '<strong>00-backup_freelcs_configuration.sh</strong>' to make
        a backup of the installation settings. Files needed for restoration and
        a restoration script will be created in directory '<strong>freelcs_backup</strong>'.</li>
      <li>Copy the contents of dir '<strong>freelcs_backup</strong>' to all
        machines that you want to have the same configuration and run the
        restoration script '<strong>00-restore_freelcs_configuration.sh</strong>'
        on each. </li>
      <li>The restoration script will install all programs and scripts that
        FreeLCS needs to function. After restoration all machines will have
        identical FreeLCS installation. </li>
      <li>Reboot the machines or start loudness correction scripts manually
        (restoration script displays the startup command at the end of the run).<br>
      </li>
    </ol>
    Result: The FreeLCS installation has been cloned to several machines.<br>
    <br>
    <h3> Important notes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>It is very important that you restore FreeLCS onto the same Linux
        distro and version that it was originally installed on. There are some
        differences between Linux versions and FreeLCS adjusts the installation
        according to these differences. FreeLCS might not work correctly if
        restored onto a wrong distro or version.</li>
      <li>When you first run the FreeLCS installer you define which user account
        is used to run FreeLCS programs. It is important that you create this
        same user on all machines where you restore a FreeLCS backup. If the
        user account defined during FreeLCS installation does not exist then
        FreeLCS programs fail to run.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS installation requires either a connection to the internet or
        access to a local Debian / Ubuntu package repository.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="How to report a bug">How to report a bug</a></h2>
    If you have found an error in FreeLCS software or documentation please
    report it so that it can be corrected.<br>
    <br>
    If you find that FreeLCS software crashes or behaves in ways it should not,
    try first to find out if the problem is caused by a file in the HotFolder.
    If a certain file or file format causes the problem please make a copy of
    the file / files for later use. The files might be needed to confirm that
    the bugfix really solves the problem.<br>
    <br>
    When you file a bugreport keep in mind that the developer needs to be able
    to reproduce the bug in his own system in order to fix it. So when reporting
    a bug report the following:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The operating system version that you use.</li>
      <li>The version of the FreeLCS - package that you use.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The steps that needs to be done in order to make the bug appear.</li>
      <li>If a file causes the bug and you want to send the file to the
        developer, then store the file in a cloud file storage system for
        example DropBox's Public - folder and add the download link to the bug
        report.</li>
      <li>Error messages are good sources for information when hunting a bug, so
        if you get one please add it to the bug report.</li>
      <li>If a program just stops working, then it has crashed. In most cases
        the program is not able to show any error message to the user because
        the program runs in the background. An error message holds valuable
        information about what went wrong and if you want to help to sort out
        the cause of the error you can run the program manually in Terminal.
        When a program is run manually in Terminal the user can see all possible
        error messages. <a href="#Run%20FreeLCS%20programs%20so%20that%20possible%20error%20messages%20can%20be%20seen">Click

    <h2><a id="Run FreeLCS programs so that possible error messages can be seen">Run
        FreeLCS programs so that possible error messages can be seen</a></h2>
    <h3>LoudnessCorrection.py</h3>
    <br>
    LoudnessCorrection.py is the program that is responsible for processing the
    files that appear in the HotFolder. Normally LoudnessCorrection.py runs in
    the background and has no way to display error messages to the user. The
    program can however be manually started in the Terminal.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the Terminal and stop all FreeLCS programs with the command (asks
        for root password): <strong>sudo systemctl stop freelcs<br>
        </strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now there are two ways to run LoudnessCorrection.py, the first one
      discards all settings user defined in the installer and runs with default
      settings. When you run the program in this mode you need to add the full
      path to the target directory at the end of the command. The target
      directory is the directory which has Hotfolder "<strong>LoudnessCorrection</strong>"
      inside it. Note that running the program like this the language defaults
      to english meaning the program expects the HotFolder name to be "<strong>LoudnessCorrection</strong>".</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Run the program with default settings: <strong>/usr/bin/LoudnessCorrection.py
          /mountpoint/</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that when running in this mode the program outputs a lot of text, it
      tells all the time what it is doing.<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>The second way to run LoudnessCorrection.py is to use the settings that
      user defined in the installer. The settings are stored in file <strong>/etc/Loudness_Correction_Settings.pickle</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Run the program with user defined settings: <strong>/usr/bin/LoudnessCorrection.py
          -configfile /etc/Loudness_Correction_Settings.pickle</strong><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freelcs/tickets/"></a> <br>
    When running in this mode there will be no output unless the program
    crashes. <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>HeartBeat_Checker.py</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have not already done so open the Terminal and stop all FreeLCS
        programs (asks for root password): <strong>sudo systemctl stop freelcs</strong><br>
      </li>
      <li>Run HeartBeat_Checker manually in Terminal: <strong>/usr/bin/HeartBeat_Checker.py
          -configfile /etc/Loudness_Correction_Settings.pickle</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    HeartBeat_Checker does not display anything unless it crashes.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Installer.py</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Open Terminal and navigate to the directory where installer.py is
        located.</li>
      <li>Make installer executable with this command: <strong>chmod 755
          installer.py</strong></li>
      <li>Run installer with command:&nbsp; <strong>./installer.py</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Installer only displays something if it crashes.<br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Typical Python error message</h3>
    If a program crashes then the Python3 interpreter displays an error message
    telling what went wrong. A typical Python error message looks like this:<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    If you get a message like this please copy it to the bug report. This
    message is valuable since it tells the developer exactly on which line of
    the program code the error happened.<br>
    <br>
    To copy text from the Terminal first select the text to be copied and then
    copy it with the keyboard command: <strong>shift + ctrl + c</strong><br>
    <br>
    Paste the text to the bug report.<br>

    <h2><a id="FreeLCS development">FreeLCS development</a></h2>
    FreeLCS development happens on Github ( <a href="https://github.com/mhartzel/freelcs">https://github.com/mhartzel/freelcs</a>).
    All new versions of software are uploaded there before official release.
    Unreleased versions are untested so it is recommended that normal users do
    not use these versions on their production servers. The reason for this is
    that when new program code is added and old is modified it is possible that
    new bugs creep in.<br>
    <br>
    If however you have encountered a bug you can navigate to that webpage and
    check the changelog there (Documentation/Changelog.txt) to see if the bug
    has already been fixed. If you want to test the latest software versions you
    can download all files in the git-repository like this:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the Terminal and get root - permissions (asks for root password):
        <strong>sudo su</strong><br>
      </li>
      <li>Install git - software: <strong>apt-get -y install git</strong><br>
      </li>
      <li>Navigate to the directory where you want to Download the latest
        FreeLCS files.</li>
      <li>Download the git-repository with the command: <strong>git clone
          http://github.com/mhartzel/freelcs.git</strong><br>
      </li>
      <li>This will create a new directory 'freelcs' and put all files inside
        it.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
