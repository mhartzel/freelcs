Ubuntu 18.04 Server
-------------------
When installing on Ubuntu 18.04 Server using XForwarding over SSH with the installer GUI open on another Desktop computer: It seems to be impossible to write the character @ into the installer window. The character is needed when writing email addresses. Please write the character in a Terminal on the Desktop computer and copy + paste it to the installer window.


Ubuntu 14.04
-------------
Ubuntu 14.04 ships with avconv version 9.11 and I encountered the following problem with it while doing regression testing with my 150 test files:

- Avconv 9.11 detects micosoft gsm audio codec format (microsoft GSM 6.10) sample rate incorrectly. 32 KHz is recognized as 8 KHz. The playback speed of the resulting output file is incorrect. This codec format is not widely used, so the impact of this bug is very low.

Ubuntu 16,04 ships with FFmpeg version 2.8.6 which fixes this problem.
