    FreeLCS stands for <strong>Free Loudness Correction Server</strong>.
    FreeLCS lets you automatically correct audio files to EBU R128 target
    loudness level -23 LUFS. Beginning from version 3.6 it is also possible to
    change the target loudness in range of -31 LUFS to -12 LUFS.<br>
    <br>
    The software lets you easily set up a server that shares one of it's folders
    to the network. Users of your network can then drop audio files to the
    server for automatic loudness correction. For each processed file the server
    also creates a loudness history graphics file which shows loudness
    variations inside the file.<br>
    <br>
    The software is very fast even on modest hardware giving 15 times faster
    than realtime processing (16 bit stereo files, TruePeak measurement turned
    on) on a server with one Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4 GB Ram, 3 internal
    Sata disks in software RAID 0.<br>
    <br>
    FreeLCS uses other open source programs to get the job done (Linux,
    libebur128, gnuplot, FFmpeg / libav-tools (optional), sox, mediainfo). All
    software is free and Open Source.<br>

    <h1><strong>Latest news:</strong></h1>
    <h4>2020.04.30 FreeLCS 3.7 released.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>This release supports Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and Debian 10.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug that might have caused a crash when a BWF or MP2 file had
        user entered metadata (text) in some other encoding than UTF-8.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4></h4>
    <h4>2019.08.24 FreeLCS 3.6 released.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>This release supports Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and Debian 9 and 10.</li>
      <li>It is now possible to change target loudness in the range of -31 LUFS
        to -12 LUFS. This makes it possible to adjust loudness to a level that
        is more compatible with internet media sites (Youtube, Spotify, mobile
        devices, social media, etc). There are some things to be aware of when
        using higher than -23 LUFS target loudness levels. They are discussed <a
          href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#Considerations%20for%20using%20a%20target%20loudness%20higher%20than%20-23%20LUFS"
          title="Considerations for using a target loudness higher than -23 LUFS">here</a>.
        Target loudness graphics is drawn using <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Loudness%20history%20graphics%20when%20target%20loudness%20is%20set%20to%20-16,%20-23%20and%20-31%20LUFS"
          title="Loudness history graphics when target loudness is set to -16, -23 and -31 LUFS">different
          colors depending on if target is set lower, equal or higher than -23
          LUFS</a>. Hotfolder name also changes depending on the <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Hotfolder_Name"
          title="Hotfolder_Name">selected target loudness.</a></li>
      <li>Loudness history graphics and html progress report now uses UTF-8
        character encoding.</li>
      <li>Debian 10 has AppArmor turned on by default but this does not seem to
        affect FreeLCS installation in any way. This is further discussed in the
        FAQ <a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#AppArmor">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h4>2018.05.25 FreeLCS 3.5 released.</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>This release supports Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and Debian 8 and 9.</li>
      <li>Patents for Dolby AC3, Mpeg 1 Layers 1, 2 and 3 (mp1, mp2, mp3 ) have
        expired all over the world. These formats are now patent free and can be
        used legally without paying anybody for a license. These formats (and
        the Opus - format) are now enabled if you enable free formats during
        FreeLCS installation. Extracting audio from these formats still require
        installation of FFmpeg / Libav-tools.</li>
      <li>Libebur128 upgraded to the latest version 1.2.4. Libebur128 by default
        builds taglib into the 'loudness' executable. Taglib does not build
        cleanly anymore on older distros probably due to old gcc - versions.
        Because of this building taglib with libebur128 is disabled on Debian 8
        and Ubuntu 16.04. Taglib is used to read and write metadata into files
        (For Example ID3 - data in mp3 files), so you probably don't need it for
        anything anyway. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TagLib">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TagLib</a></li>

    <h1> <a id="Features">Features</a></h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Automatically loudness corrects audio files to conform with EBU R128
        loudness recommendation.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use, just drop in your file and copy back the loudness
        corrected version.</li>
      <li>Creates loudness history graphics that allows the user to see how
        loudness varies inside a file (example picture below).</li>
      <li>Supports channel counts from mono to 5.1.</li>
      <li>Supports EBU TruePeak measurement.</li>
      <li>Uses a protective limiter to keep peaks in the allowed range where
