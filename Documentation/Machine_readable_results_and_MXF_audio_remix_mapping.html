    <p>FreeLCS 3.0 lets you define how it outputs its results. Most users will
      want the old behavior from FreeLCS version up to 2.4 that is: create a
      loudness corrected audio file, a history graphics file and delete
      multistream files immediately after all audiostreams have been extracted
      to individual files (multistream extraction requires installation of
      FFmpeg or libav-tools). This "old" behaviour is achieved by setting "<strong>Use
        FreeLCS file output defaults</strong>" to <strong>"Yes"</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you would like to integrate FreeLCS as a loudness measurement step in
      your automated file processing workflow, then you might want to change the
      defaults.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    When you set "<strong>Use FreeLCS file output defaults</strong>" to "<strong>No</strong>",
    then you can change settings for the output files FreeLCS creates.<br>
    <br>
    If your FreeLCS - machine is the loudness measurement step in an automated
    file processing workflow, then you might want to disable some output file
    creation. You can prevent creation of loudness corrected files and history
    graphics files. You can also prevent FreeLCS from deleting multistream input
    files after audio extraction if you need the original file to remain on the
    disk for further processing.<br>
    <br>
    FreeLCS 3.0 is also able to output loudness measurement results in a machine
    readable file. You might want this if some other device needs to read in
    loudness measurement results to make a decision about how the file is
    processed further.<br>

    <h2><a id="Separator_characters_in_the_machine_readable_results_file">Separator
        characters in the machine readable results file</a></h2>
    <p>There can be many audio streams in one input file, FreeLCS writes these
      streams to individual audio files before loudness processing (multistream
      support requires FFmpeg or libav-tools). As a single input file can result
      in many output files, the machine readable results file may consist of
      loudness results of many audio files. </p>
    <p>Loudness measurement results of a single file needs to be separated from
      each other by a known character or group of characters for a machine be
      able to interpret the results. If the input file resulted to many output
      files, then we need to separate each record of results with another known
      character or group of characters. The separator characters must be chosen
      from a group of characters that can never appear in a file name.<br>
    </p>
    <p>This problem has been solved when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII
        character set</a> was designed. The designers assigned two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter#ASCII_delimited_text">characters
        for this job</a>: <strong>ASCII character 31</strong> is meant for
      separating different values from each other and <strong>ASCII character
        30</strong> is meant for separating different records of data from each
      other. Character 31 is called the <strong>Unit Separator</strong> and
      character 30 is called the <strong>Record Separator</strong>. The
      operating system doesn't allow these characters in file names, so they are
      safe to use as data separators.</p>
    <p>The machine readable results file is a simple text file with loudness
      measurement results written to it. Sometimes there might be reason for a
      person to open a machine readable results file in a text editor to check
      the values inside it. This is not possible if the ASCII character 30 is
      used as the record separator. In this case the user sees the results as
      one huge continuous line of text. This is why I chose to use the windows
      line feed string (ASCII character 13 followed with character 10) as the
      default record separator. When this record separator is used, then a
      machine readable results file becomes much more readable when opened in a
      text editor, because the editor splits results for individual audio files
      as separate lines of text.</p>
    <p>However you can select any non printable ASCII character as the unit and
      record separator. You can use 1 or 2 character strings for each.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Machine_readable_results_file_format">Machine readable results
        file format</a></h2>
    <p>The machine readable results file name is constructed like this:&nbsp;<strong>
        InputFileName-machine_readable_results.txt</strong></p>
    <p>Example: Input file name is:&nbsp; <strong>Euroviisut-2007-Final.mp4</strong></p>
    <p>Machine readable results file name is:&nbsp; <strong>Euroviisut-2007-Final.mp4-machine_readable_results.txt</strong></p>
    <p>When you know the name of the input file, then you can get the machine
      readable results file name just by appending "<strong>-machine_readable_results.txt</strong>"
      to the name.<br>
      <strong></strong></p>
    <p><strong><br>
      </strong></p>
    <p>A machine readable results file has information about all audio streams
      of a single input file. Values for a single output stream are separated
      with the unit separator string. The record separator string is placed
      where a record of values for one audio stream ends and a record of values
      for the next audio stream begins. Unit and record separator strings are
      both defined during FreeLCS installation.</p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Item 0:</strong> The number of this audio stream. If there are
        many audio streams in the input file, then this number tells you which
        one of these streams this mix is.</li>
      <li><strong>Item 1</strong>: Total number of supported streams in the
        input file. There can be both unsupported and supported streams in a
        input file. This value tells you how many streams FreeLCS is able to
        process from the input file.</li>
      <li><strong>Item 2</strong>: Total number of streams in the input file.
        This number contains both the unsupported and supported streams in a
        input file.</li>
      <li><strong>Item 3</strong>: Create Loudness Corrected Files (True /
        False). This value tells you if the user has instructed FreeLCS to
        create loudness corrected files or not (this is set during FreeLCS
        installation). If this is "False" then FreeLCS will not produce loudness
        corrected audio files.</li>
      <li><strong>Item 4</strong>: Number of files in this audio stream. This
        tells you how many audio files this audio stream resulted to. This
        number is always 1 except in two cases. It is 0 when an error happened
        and FreeLCS was not able to process the stream. In this case this number
        tells you that there are zero resulting output files.&nbsp; The other
        case when this value differs from 1 is when the output file size is so
        big that FreeLCS needs to split the file to one file per audio channel.
        In this case this number tells you the number of audio files the audio
        stream was split into. Items from number 14-&gt; will tell you names of
        the output files.</li>

    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Item 12:</strong> This value holds possible error codes. If
        this value is 0 then FreeLCS successfully processed the stream,
        otherwise processing failed and there will be no loudness calculation
        results nor loudness corrected files for this stream. Error code <strong>9</strong>
        means that in addition of supported files, there are some audio files
        inside the MXF wrapper that FreeLCS is not able to process. When MXF
        audio remixing feature is on, then this situation may produce unexpected
        results meaning that audio channels inside the MXF file might be
        combined in ways that the user did not anticipate. MXF audio remixing
        works correctly only when FreeLCS is able to process all files inside
        the MXF wrapper. </li>

    <strong>2</strong> = Error in integrated loudness calculation<br>
    <strong>3</strong> = File transfer failed<br>
    <strong>4</strong> = Audio duration is less than 1 second<br>

    <strong>7</strong> = No Audio Streams Found In File <br>
    <strong>8</strong> = Sox encountered an error<br>
    <strong>9</strong> = There are unsupported audio streams in input MXF - file
    while MXF audio remixing function is on. When MXF audio remixing feature is
    on, then this situation may produce unexpected results meaning that audio
    channels inside the MXF file might be combined in ways that the user did not
    anticipate. MXF audio remixing works correctly only when FreeLCS is able to
    process all files inside the MXF wrapper.<br>
    <strong>10</strong> = File wrapper format is not supported<br>
    <strong>11</strong> = Audio compression codec is not supported<br>
    <strong>100</strong> = Unknown Error<br>
    <br>
    If you want a machine to interpret the values inside the machine readable
    file, then you first must check the <strong>item 12</strong> for errors. If
    <strong>item 12</strong> is zero, then FreeLCS successfully processed the
    file. Then check <strong>item 1</strong> for information about how many
    output files resulted from the input file. <strong>Item 1</strong> tells
    you how many loudness results you need to read (one record of results for
    each supported input stream). Now you can read in the loudness measurement
    results for each supported input stream (<strong>items 5 - 7</strong> for
    each record). If <strong>item 12</strong> is not zero, then an error
    happened and there are no loudness calculation results to read (exception
    error code 9). The error number tells you what the the error was and the
    error message text is located in item <strong>13</strong>. <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Example 1:</h3>
    FreeLCS has processed a input file that has only one audio stream in it. It
    is a wav file named: <strong>Test_File-01.wav</strong>&nbsp; The machine
    readable results file name is:&nbsp; <strong>Test_File-01.wav-machine_readable_results.txt</strong><br>
    <br>
    The values inside the machine readable results file are below. Note that I
    have changed the unit separator character to comma here to make the text
    more human readable :)<br>
    <br>
    <strong style="font-family: monospace;">1, 1, 1, True, 1, -22.9, 12.2, -6.7,
      2, 48000, 16, 3070, 0,&nbsp; , Test_File-01_-23_LUFS.wav</strong><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Example 2:</h3>
    FreeLCS has processed a transport stream file that had 14 audio streams in
    it. All streams were first saved to separate files and then went through
    loudness processing.<br>
    <br>
    The input file name was:&nbsp; <strong>20120712-2000-0000091191.mpg</strong>&nbsp;
    and the machine readable results file name was:&nbsp; <strong>20120712-2000-0000091191.mpg-machine_readable_results.txt</strong><br>
    <br>
    The result records for the files are separated by the record separator, in
    this case it is ASCII characters 13 and 10 (which is the code that instructs
    a text editor to split the text to separate text lines).<br>
    <br>
    There are now 14 records of results because the one input file resulted in
    14 output files. Note that there was an error processing streams 4 and 6.
    The streams were present in the transport stream, but they had zero audio
    channels.<br>
    <br>
    The values inside the machine readable results file are below. Note that I

    <h2><a id="MXF_audio_remixing">MXF audio remixing</a></h2>
    <p>FreeLCS 3.0 lets you define how you want audio inside an MXF file to be
      recombined before loudness processing. This feature is called MXF audio
      remixing. <br>
      <strong></strong></p>
    <p>If you want to use MXF audio remixing, then you must install FFmpeg or
      libav-tools and allow MXF wrapper format processing during FreeLCS
      installation. </p>
    <p><strong>Important note:</strong> This function is not guaranteed to work
      !!!!!!! MXF is not one format, but a family of formats (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Exchange_Format#MXF_in_use">more
        info on Wikipedia</a>). Every hardware and software vendor seem to have
      their own version of it. MXF files created with one device might not be
      compatible with a device created by another vendor. Because of this there
      is no guarantee that FreeLCS can process every MXF - file you feed it. It
      might be a good idea to do a thorough test with a large set of different
      MXF files before you make this feature part of your workflow.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3><a id="The_MXF_Problem">The MXF Problem</a><br>
    </h3>
    <p>Consider an example where video and audio of a program is wrapper inside
      an MXF wrapper. The program has two versions of the audio: a stereo
      version (2 channels) and an 5.1 version (6 channels). Audio might be
      stored inside the MXF wrapper as one 8 channel audio file (<strong>Example
        1</strong>), or as 8 separate mono files (<strong>Example 2</strong>).</p>

    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Audio from these MXF files can't be processed with FreeLCS because it has
      no knowledge about which files belong to the same audio version (mix).
      This information can be provided to FreeLCS in the form of a MXF remix
      map.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="MXF_remix_map">MXF remix map</a></h2>
    <p>A MXF remix map tells FreeLCS how audio channels inside a MXF file must
      be recombined before loudness processing. When a remix map is active then
      FreeLCS first extracts audio from the MXF wrapper and then recombines
      audio channels according to the remix map and writes each resulting mix to
      a separate audio file. Then FreeLCS moves these files to the HotFolder so
      that they go through the normal loudness processing.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3><a id="Default_MXF_remix_map">Default MXF remix map</a></h3>
    <p> You can define a default remix map during FreeLCS installation. This
      default map is used when there is no other information available about a
      specific MXF file.</p>
    <p>In the picture below a green number above a box corresponds to the number
      of the mix. The number inside a box defines how many audio channels this
      mix has. A total of 48 remix parameters can be defined meaning that
      channels inside an MXF file can be recombined to max 48 new audio files.
      The default remix map is all number 2's. This means that if there is no
      file specific MXF remix map found then recombine all audio files found
      inside a MXF file to stereo files.</p>
    If you know all your MXF files have these four mixes:
    <ol>
      <li>Stereo</li>
      <li>5.1</li>
      <li>Stereo</li>
      <li>Stereo</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Then you could define a default remix map of: <strong>2, 6, 2, 2</strong>&nbsp;
      meaning that you put number 2's in boxes 1, 3 and 4 and number 6 in box 2.
      You can have more mix definitions than you have physical audio channels
      inside your MXF files, FreeLCS only recreates those mixes that can be
      completely created with audio channels available in the MXF file. If there
      are more audio channels inside an MXF file than is needed to recreate all
      mixes in the remix map, then the extra channels are not used for anything.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="Pictures/MXF_Remixing-01.jpg">
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3><a id="File_specific_MXF_remix_map">File specific MXF remix map</a></h3>
    <p>In addition to the default remix map the user can use file specific MXF
      remix maps. A file specific remix map overrides the default remix map
      defined during installation. For example if most of your files have the
      same channel configuration, then you would assign this configuration to
      the default MXF remix map during FreeLCS installation. Once in a while you
      might want to process a file that has a channel configuration differing
      from your regular MXF files. In this case you could override the default
      channel configuration only for this file with a file specific remix map.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>A file specific remix map is a simple <strong>text file</strong> that
      contains channel counts separated with a comma. The name of the remix map
      file is always the same as the name of the MXF file it is used for, except
      the file extension of the original file "<strong>.mxf</strong>" is
      replaced with "<strong>.remix_map</strong>". You can have more mix
      definitions than you have physical audio channels inside your MXF file,
      FreeLCS only recreates those mixes that can be completely created with
      audio channels available in the MXF file. If there are more audio channels
      inside an MXF file than is needed to recreate all mixes in the remix map,
      then the extra channels are not used for anything.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    The user wants to extract 5 mixes from an MXF file. These mixes are:<strong>
      stereo, 5.1, stereo, stereo, 5.0</strong><br>
    <br>
    MXF file name:&nbsp; <strong>Testfile.mxf</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <br> Remix map file name:&nbsp; <strong>Testfile.remix_map</strong><br>
    Contents of the remix map file:&nbsp; <strong>2,6,2,2,5</strong><br>
    <p>As you can see, it is very easy to use file specific remix maps. You just
      create a text file and put some numbers in it separated by commas. The
      numbers are the channel counts for each mix you want FreeLCS to recombine
      before loudness processing. </p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> a file specific remix map must be in the
      FreeLCS HotFolder <strong>BEFORE</strong> the MXF file arrives there.
      FreeLCS checks once for each MXF file if it can find the corresponding
      file specific remix map, and if it is not found then FreeLCS processes the
      file according to the information it has available then. FreeLCS won't
      check for the existence of a remix map again after processing has started.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Detailed_explanation_of_the_channel_remixing_feature">Detailed
        explanation of the channel remixing feature<br>
      </a></h2>
    <p>I have seen some very peculiar MXF files. One file had several mono audio
      files in it except in between the mono files there was a single stereo
      file. How is FreeLCS supposed to know from which file to take the audio
      channels user has defined in a remix map ? Because of this peculiarity I
      designed FreeLCS to be "blind" to the physical audio files inside a MXF
      file, FreeLCS only "sees" a bunch of audio channels available to it.
      FreeLCS does not care which physical file the channel comes from, it just
      uses channels starting from file 1 channel 1 and going forward to the next
      file until it gets all channels needed to fulfill a channel count defined
      in a remix map.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Example:</strong></p>
    <p>Most MXF files will have several mono files or 8 channel files inside but
      consider this theoretical example. Suppose the channel counts in audio
      files inside a MXF file was:</p>
    Audio file 1: <strong>channels 1</strong><br>
    Audio file 2: <strong>channels 2</strong><br>
    Audio file 3: <strong>channels 3</strong><br>
    Audio file 4: <strong>channels 4</strong><br>
    <p>What happens if the user defines a channel map where required channel
      counts for each mix to recreate is the opposite of the available channels
      inside the MXF:</p>
    <p>Remix map: <strong>4, 3, 2, 1</strong></p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>This is how FreeLCS gets channels for each channel count defined in the
      remix map:</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Channels left in physical audio files before processing starts: <strong>1,
        2, 3, 4</strong></p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Remix map item 1 needs 4 channels</strong>: FreeLCS&nbsp; takes
      all channels from physical files: 1 and 2 totalling 3 channels, then it
      needs one more channel and takes the first channel of file 3. After the
      first mix is created channels left in physical audio files: <strong>0, 0,
        2, 4</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Remix map item 2 needs 3 channels</strong>: FreeLCS takes the 2
      channels that are left in physical file 3 and then the first channel from
      physical file 4. After the second mix is created channels left in physical
      audio files: <strong>0, 0, 0, 3</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Remix map item 3 needs 2 channels</strong>: FreeLCS takes
      channels 2 and 3 that are still unused in physical file 4. After the third
      mix is created channels left in physical audio files: <strong>0, 0, 0, 1</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>Remix map item 4 needs 1 channels</strong>: Then we only have
      channel 4 left of physical file 4 and that fulfills the last remix map
      definition for 1 channels. After the fourth mix is created channels left
      in physical audio files: <strong>0, 0, 0, 0</strong>.</p>
    <p></p>
