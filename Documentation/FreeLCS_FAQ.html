    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>FreeLCS is a tool to automatically adjust loudness of audio files
        according to the EBU R128 recommendation.<br>
      </li>
      <li>EBU R128 is designed for professional broadcasters to help eliminate
        loudness jumps between broadcasted programs. Files adjusted according to
        R128 will at the same loudness level.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS is a Linux server that shares one of it's folders to the
        network.</li>
      <li>Users of your network can then drop audio files to the server for
        automatic loudness correction.</li>
      <li>For each processed file the server also creates a loudness history
        graphics file which shows loudness variations inside the file.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS is open source and free software. You don't have to pay
        anything to use it :)<br>
      </li>
      <li>FreeLCS site is here: <a href="http://freelcs.sourceforge.net/">http://freelcs.sourceforge.net/</a></li>

    <br>
    <h2> <a id="What programs are used to process audio files ?">What programs
        are used to process audio files ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Natively supported formats are <strong>wav</strong>, <strong>flac</strong>
        and <strong>ogg</strong>. If <strong>FFmpeg </strong>or<strong>
          libav-tools</strong> is installed then it's used to extract and
        convert audio from unsupported formats to wav and flac.<br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Mediainfo</strong> gets duration info from mpeg transport
        stream files.<br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>libebur128</strong> measures integrated and momentary loudness
        and maximum true peak value.</li>
      <li><strong>Sox</strong> adjusts file loudness to target level and also
        provides protective limiting in cases where it is needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Gnuplot</strong> creates loudness results graphics from
        momentary loudness calculations provided by libebur128.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="What formats are supported ?">What formats are supported ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wav</strong>, <strong>flac</strong> and <strong>ogg</strong>
        are natively supported.</li>
      <li>If FFmpeg or libav-tools is installed then it is used to convert other
        formats to supported formats before processing. FFmpeg and Libav-tools
        both support a large number of formats: <strong>mp4</strong>, <strong>mp3</strong>,
        <strong>mp2</strong>, <strong>avi</strong>, <strong>mov</strong>, <strong>aac</strong>,
        <strong>h264</strong>, <strong>vob</strong>, <strong>mkv</strong> to
        name a few. FFmpeg and Libav-tools are able to extract all audio streams
        from supported file types including video files. <br>
      </li>
      <li>Note that all channels of one mix must be in the same file. If your
        5.1 mix consists of 6 files, then you must combine them before dropping
        the mix into loudness correction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Libav-tools_vs_FFmpeg">Libav-tools vs. FFmpeg</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>In 2011 a group of FFmpeg developers decided to take FFmpeg's source
        code and start a new project with it. The reason for this "fork" was the
        group was unhappy with the way the main FFmpeg developer managed the
        project. The group named the new project Libav and renamed the video
        and&nbsp; audio conversion program from <strong>ffmpeg</strong> to <strong>avconv</strong>.
        This "fork" created a new project that continued development of the
        FFmpeg source code parallel to the FFmpeg - project. Both projects have
        slowly evolved their own way creating a puzzling situation for the user.
        Tools that both projects develop (FFmpeg and avconv) are quite similar
        by features, but there are differences in capabilites and usage here and
        there. More about the FFmpeg vs. libav situation can be read <a href="http://blog.pkh.me/p/13-the-ffmpeg-libav-situation.html">here</a>.</li>
      <li>This change from FFmpeg to libav-tools turned out to be a short one.
        As of 2016.07 distributions are migrating away from libav back to
        FFmpeg. Ubuntu 16.04 only has FFmpeg available in its repositories and
        Debian 9 is going to make this change also. Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 and
        Debian 7 and 8 only offers libav-tools in their repositories.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2><a id="Libav-tools / FFmpeg and patents">Avconv / FFmpeg and patents</a><br>
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Most audio post production is done in <strong>Wav</strong> format
        because it is very widely supported and can be used without paying
        license fees for the use of the format (source: <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000025.shtml">http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000025.shtml</a>,&nbsp;
        <a href="http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000001.shtml">http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000001.shtml</a>).
        FreeLCS supports wav and two royalty / patent free formats <strong>flac</strong>
        and <strong>ogg </strong>(license: <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/license.html">http://flac.sourceforge.net/license.html</a>).
        If your production is done in wav then you don't ever need to install
        libav-tools or FFmpeg.</li>
      <li>Avconv / FFmpeg is a video and audio conversion tool that can be used
        to convert media to many different formats. Using avconv or FFmpeg to
        decompress audio from patented formats may require a license from the
        rights holders. However avconv may also be used to process free formats
        (MXF, MKV, WebM and others) or formats with possibly expired patents
        (Mpeg1 Layer1, Mpeg 1 Layer2) without acquiring licenses (source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1#Patents">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1#Patents</a>).
        To more complicate things some patented formats may be patented in some
        countries but not in others. Also the expiration dates for these patents
        may vary between countries.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS uses avconv or FFmpeg if it's installed but works fine without
        it with wav, flac and ogg formats.</li>
      <li>As of 2018 patents of some popular audio formats have been expired:
        Dolby AC-3, Mpeg 1 layers 1, 2 and 3 (the last one is more commonly
        known as mp3). These formats are now free and can be used freely without
        paying any lisence fees. Sources: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Digital#License">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Digital#License</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <ul>
      <li>Yes, in FreeLCS 3.0 you can set avconv / FFmpeg allowed formats during
        installation. In the following picture below allowed wrapper formats are
        restricted to:&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>wav</strong>, <strong>flac</strong>
        <strong>ogg</strong>, <strong>matroska</strong> &nbsp; and allowed
        codec formats are restricted to: &nbsp; <strong>pcm</strong>, <strong>flac</strong>,

    <h2> <a id="How many audio streams in a file are supported ?">How many
        audio streams in a file are supported ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>When FFmpeg or libav-tools is not installed: 1 audio stream.<br>
      </li>
      <li>When FFmpeg or libav-tools is installed: the limit for the number of
        audio streams in a single file has not been tested. I personally have
        tested files with 16 streams with no problems. Upper limit is propably
        set by a possible limit in FFmpeg / libav-tools or file format in
        question.<br>

    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2> <a id="What is the maximum / minimum file duration supported ?">What
        is the maximum / minimum file duration supported ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The shortest supported file duration is exactly 1 second.</li>
      <li>The longest supported file duration should in theory be unlimited, but
        no tests have been made to find out the limit.</li>
      <li>The longest real world file I have tested was 18 hours of 16 bit
        Stereo Mpeg 1 Layer 2 compressed audio from television
        transmission.&nbsp; The longest test files (with only 1 kHz sine wave)
        were 33 hours of Flac compressed 24 bit stereo audio and 388 hours of
        ogg vorbis compresses stereo audio. The last one is 16 days of
        continuous audio and the loudness corrected version was a 51 GB flac -
        compressed file :)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="What is the output format of FreeLCS ?">What is the output format
        of FreeLCS ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>FreeLCS output format is wav if output file size does not exceed wav
        format max size 4 GB. In case of very large files the output format is
        flac. See also question: <a href="#What%20happens%20if%20output%20file%20size%20exceeds%20wav%20format%204%20GB%20size%20limit%20?">What
          happens if output file size exceeds wav format 4 GB size limit ?</a><br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="What happens to the files when they are processed ?">What happens
        to the files when they are processed ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>First incoming files are searched for supported audio streams.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS natively supports wav, flac and ogg formats and one audio
        stream per file. If there are more streams or the audio format is
        unsupported then FFmpeg / libav-tools is used (only if FFmpeg or
        libav-tools is installed) to convert streams to a supported format.<br>
      </li>
      <li>FFmpeg / Libav-tools places extracted streams back to FreeLCS
        HotFolder so that they are seen as new files coming into processing.
        When all streams have been extracted then the original file is deleted
        as it is no longer needed.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Then two simultaneous loudness calculation processes are started for
        the file. One measures integrated loudness and the other momentary
        loudness. Momentary loudness is calculated in 3 second slices for files
        longer than 12 seconds and in 0.5 seconds slices for files shorter than
        that. </li>
      <li>After loudness measurement Gnuplot creates a loudness result graphics
        file from momentary loudness measurements provided by libebur128.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Then a new loudness adjusted file is created with sox. Loudness of
        this file is at EBU R128 target level <strong>-23.0 LUFS</strong>.</li>
      <li>All files will be automatically deleted after a delay defined during
        FreeLCS installation, default is 8 hours.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Is TruePeak measurement supported ?">Is TruePeak measurement
        supported ?</a></h2>
    <p>Yes :) When you install the software you can choose which method of peak
      measurement is used: sample peak or TruePeak.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Is peak limiting used when loudness correction adjusts volume up ?">Is
        peak limiting used when loudness correction adjusts volume up ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If file gain is adjusted down then no peak limiting is needed as the
        peaks also go down.</li>
      <li>If file gain must be adjusted up then a protective limiter is used but
        only if peaks would go over a set limit after gain correction.<br>
      </li>
      <li>The max peaks after gain adjustment will be at -3 dBFS when using
        sample peaks and -1 dBTP when using TruePeak.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="What happens to the internal dynamics of a processed file ?">What
        happens to the internal dynamics of a processed file ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The dynamics inside an audio file are not changed in any way, only the
        gain of the whole file is adjusted up or down so that the average
        loudness of file hits -23.0 LUFS. For example if measured file loudness
        is at -20.0 LUFS, then all samples of the file will be adjusted down by
        3 dBs when loudness corrected file is created.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="What channel orders are supported ?">What channel orders are
        supported ?</a></h2>
    The following channel orders are supported:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>1.0 = Mono</li>
      <li>2.0 = L, R.<br>
      </li>
      <li>3.0 = Any channel order for front channels L, R, C.</li>
      <li>4.0 = L, R, LS, RS.</li>
      <li>5.0 = L, R, C, LS, RS.</li>
      <li>5.1 = L, R, C, LFE, LS, RS.</li>
    </ul>
    Ebu R128 recommendation (or to be more precise ITU 1770 that R128 refers to)
    does not support any specific channel order, it only defines how loudness
    measurement of: <strong>Front</strong>, <strong>Surround</strong> and <strong>LFE</strong>
    channels differs from each other. Surround channels are weighted differently
    from front channels and LFE channel is always discarded from loudness
    calculation. This means that for example in the case of 3.0 any channel
    order is supported since all of the channels L, R, C are front channels and
    weighted equally in loudness calculation.<br>
    <p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Channel counts of more than six channels are not supported and not
        processed !!!!!!!</li>
      <li>All channels of one mix must be in the same file. If your 5.1 mix
        consists of 6 files, then you must combine them before dropping the mix
        into loudness correction.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="What is the calculation precision ?">What is the calculation
        precision ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio gain adjustment is done with sox and it uses 32 bits by default
        for all calculations.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If output file bit depth is not 32 bits, then sox uses dithering by
        default. The output file has the same bit depth as the input file in
        most cases.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="Is bit depth and sample rate preserved ?">Is bit depth and sample
        rate preserved ?</a></h2>
    Sample rate should be preserved in all cases. <br>
    <br>
    The following rules for bit depth conversion comes from internal limitations
    in sox and FFmpeg / libav-tools.<br>
    <br>
    <u><strong>When </strong></u><u><strong>FFmpeg and libav-tools are not
        installed:</strong></u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>64 bit audio is not supported.</li>
      <li>If audio is in uncompressed PCM - format, then bit depth is preserved.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If audio has been compressed with ogg then the audio has no real bit
        depth anymore and audio will be extracted using bit depth of 16 bits.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If audio is in flac format then bit depth is preserved except that 8
        bit audio is converted to 16 bits. Flac supports bit depths up to 24
        bits.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <u><strong>When </strong></u><u><strong>FFmpeg or libav-tools is installed:</strong></u><br>
    <ul>
      <li>If audio is in uncompressed PCM - format, then bit depth is preserved
        except that 64 bit audio will be converted to 32 bits because sox
        supports bit depths only up to 32 bits.</li>
      <li>If audio has been compressed using a lossy codec then the audio has no
        real bit depth anymore and audio will be extracted using 16 bits.</li>
      <li>If output file size exceeds 4 GBs then FreeLCS must store the audio in
        flac format when processing it. Bit depths bigger than 16 will be
        converted to 16 bits on <strong>Ubuntu 12.04</strong> and <strong>Debian
          7</strong>. This is caused by an internal limitation in libav-tools
        version distributed with Ubuntu 12.04 and Debian 7, it always uses 16
        bits when storing in flac format. Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian 8 both ship
        with a new version of libav-tools that is able to store 24 bit flac
        files. Bit depths bigger than 24 will be converted to 24 bits. 8 bit
        audio will be converted to 16 bits on all supported platforms if output
        file size exceeds 4 GB.</li>

    <h2><a id="What happens if output file size exceeds wav format 4 GB size limit ?">What
        happens if output file size exceeds wav format 4 GB size limit ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio production is usually done in wav format since wav is so widely
        supported. The wav format has a max supported file size of 4 GB.</li>
      <li>If the output file size would exceed this hard limit then FreeLCS
        splits audio channels in the file to separate wav - files. If the size
        of a separate channel would also go over the 4 GB limit then FreeLCS
        saves all channels of the file in a single flac file. Flac - format
        supports very large files.</li>
      <li>There are new revisions of the wav format (RF64, W64) that can store
        files larger than 4 GB, but I have not tested these formats.&nbsp; RF64
        and W64 are not yet very widely supported.<br>

        FreeLCS remux loudness corrected audio back to the video it was
        extracted from ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No. FreeLCS tries to extract and process all audio streams from the
        video file, but it won't remux video and audio back together.</li>

    <br>
    <h2><a id="Is MXF supported ?">Is MXF supported ?</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>FFmpeg and Libav-tools both supports MXF and I've been able to extract
        audio from MXF - wrapped files with it. FreeLCS 3.0 allows the user to
        define MXF audio remix maps that define how audio is to be recombined to
        different mixes before loudness processing. However MXF is not one
        format, but a family of formats. Every hardware and software vendor seem
        to have their own version of it. MXF files created with one device might
        not be compatible with a device created by another vendor. Because of
        this there is no guarantee that FreeLCS can process every MXF - file you
        feed it. It might be a good idea to do a thorough test with a large set
        of different MXF files before you make this feature part of your
        workflow. More about MXF Audio Remixing can be found in the <a href="Machine_readable_results_and_MXF_audio_remix_mapping.html#MXF_audio_remixing">user

    The plan is to support all stable <strong>Debian </strong>releases
    starting from version <strong>7 </strong>and<strong> </strong>all future
    <strong>Ubuntu</strong> <strong>LTS</strong> releases.<br>
    <br>
    LTS stands for <strong>L</strong>ong <strong>T</strong>erm <strong>S</strong>upport.
    Ubuntu LTS releases get security updates for 5 years from the first release
    date. <strong>Ubuntu 14.04 LTS</strong> will get security updates until
    April 2019.<br>
    <br>
    Canonical releases a new Ubuntu LTS version every 2 years. If you install
    FreeLCS on Ubuntu 16.04 then you will need to upgrade the software not
    sooner than 2021.<br>

    <h2><a id="FreeLCS_error_messages" name="FreeLCS_error_messages"></a>FreeLCS
      error messages</h2>
    <p>If you enable FreeLCS to send error messages by email, then you probably
      sometimes get some messages that at first might seem puzzling. Here are
      the explanations :)</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2><a id="Critical_error_messages">Critical error messages</a></h2>
    <h3><span class="il">LoudnessCorrection</span> has stopped updating
      timestamps</h3>
    <p>If you get the following error message, then it means that FreeLCS has
      encountered an error that it can not recover from and has stopped. FreeLCS
      starts jobs in threads that periodically writes timestamps to a file. The
      script "HeartBeat_Checker.py" watches this file and sends you email if one
      or more timestamps stop updating. This means that a thread has crashed and
      you need to restart FreeLCS to restore normal operation. You can restart
      FreeLCS either by rebooting the computer or giving this command as root on
      the commandline:</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>On systemd based distros (Debian 8 and Ubuntu 16.04):</p>
    <p><strong>systemctl restart freelcs</strong></p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>On init based distros (Debian 7, Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04):</p>
    <p><strong>/etc/init.d/loudnesscorrection_init_script restart</strong></p>
    <p><strong><br>
      </strong></p>
    Note that it takes about 2 minutes for the service to start on init based
    systems (Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, Debian 7). This delay has been put in because
    it takes some time before all Linux services are available when the computer
    starts up.<strong><br>
      <br>
    </strong><br>
    I have worked very hard to make FreeLCS solid as a rock. My goal is to keep
    it 100% reliable, so that it can be used in business environments. So you
    should never see this message :) but with computers anything is possible :)
    For example a failing hard disk may corrupt FreeLCS installation.<br>

      copying files from OS X 10.7 - 10.10 to FreeLCS - Server</h2>
    <p>FreeLCS uses the smb - protocol to share its Hotfolder to the network.
      Samba is the open source implementation of the smb - protocol that FreeLCS
      uses. Apple used Samba as its smb - implementation until OS X version
      10.6. At this point Samba changed its license in a way that Apple didn't
      like and Apple decided to write their own smb implementation (smbx) from
      scratch. This is a huge task and there has been serious problems with OS
      X's interaction with other smb - implementations. OS X versions 10.7 -
      10.10 all suffer from these problems.</p>
    <p>OS X incompatibility with the smb standard causes file transfers to
      FreeLCS - server randomly stop with one of the following error messages
      (these are from OS X 10.10.4):</p>
    <img alt="" src="Pictures/Smbx-01.jpg"><br>
    <img alt="" src="Pictures/Smbx-02.jpg"><br>
    <img alt="" src="Pictures/Smbx-03.jpg"><br>
    After digging around the internet I found two workarounds for the problem.
    The solution is to force OS X to use an older version of the smb - protocol
    called <strong>cifs</strong>. These solutions are from this page: <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/mavericks-smb2-problem-and-fixes">http://www.zdnet.com/article/mavericks-smb2-problem-and-fixes</a><br>
    <h3><strong>Important !!!!!!!</strong></h3>
    <p><strong></strong>If you have problems described above, then try the
      workarounds below and try to copy files one by to the FreeLCS server. It
      seems most of the times I get these errors I have tried to transfer
      multiple files in one go.<strong><br>
      </strong></p>
    <h3>Workaround 1:</h3>
    <p>When you make the connection to FreeLCS replace "<strong>smb://</strong>"
      with "<strong>cifs://</strong>" at the beginning of the mount command.
      Save the command to the mount command list for later use.</p>
    <img alt="" src="Pictures/Smbx-04.jpg">
    <h3>Workaround 2:</h3>
    <p>Force all smb - connections to use the older <strong>cifs</strong> -
      protocol by giving this command in the Terminal. This applies only to the
      current user.</p>
    <p><strong>echo "[default]" &nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&gt; &nbsp;

    <h1><a id="Ubuntu_12.04_updates_breaks_python3">Ubuntu 12.04 updates breaks
        python3</a></h1>
    <p>While running regression tests prior to FreeLCS 3.2 release (September
      2015), I noticed that FreeLCS installation breaks on Ubuntu 12.04. It used
      to work flawlessly on this os version. The cause for the problem seems to
      be Ubuntu updates bringing in a broken version of python3. The bug crashes
      python code when HeartBeat_Checker.py and LoudnessCorrection.py are trying
      to send email to the admin. This bug has been fixed on a newer version of
      python3. If you still get email from FreeLCS when the computer starts up,
      then you are not affected by this problem.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Possible solutions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Install python3.4 from an external python repository. The author of
        this repository says he takes no responsibility for possible security
        flaws that exist in the python3 code he releases. If you can not accept
        this then the only option is to migrate away from Ubuntu 12.04.</li>
      <li>Upgrade to Ubuntu 14.04 or Debian 8. FreeLCS must be installed again
        after the os upgrade, since there are some differences between Ubuntu
        12.04 and these oses. For example Ubuntu 14.04 uses a newer version of
        Samba and the configuration file that works on Ubuntu 12.04 doesn't work
        on 14.04. Installing FreeLCS again takes care of the configuration
        changes needed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Upgrading python3 with an external python repository</h2>
    If you already installed python3 and FreeLCS, then give these commands as
    root at the terminal:<br>
    <strong><br>
    </strong>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>sudo apt-get purge python3 idle3</strong><br>
      <strong> </strong><br>
      <strong> sudo apt-get install python-software-properties</strong><br>
      <strong> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes</strong><br>
      <br>
      <strong> sudo apt-get update</strong><br>
      <strong> sudo apt-get install python3.4 idle-python3.4</strong><br>
      <strong> </strong><br>
      <strong> sudo rm /usr/bin/python3</strong><strong></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      (This removes a symbolic link that starts up python3)<br>
      <strong> sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3.4 /usr/bin/python3</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      (This creates a new symbolic link for python3 and makes it point to the
      newly installed python3.4)<br>
      <br>
      Now reboot the computer</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    If you haven't installed FreeLCS and python3, then give these commands as
    root at the terminal:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>sudo apt-get install
        python-software-properties<br>
        sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes<br>
        <br>
        sudo apt-get update<br>
        sudo apt-get install python3.4 idle-python3.4<br>
        <br>
        sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3.4 /usr/bin/python3<br>
        <br>
      </strong>Now reboot the computer</div>
    <br>
    <h2><a id="Is_there_a_way_to_find_out_FreeLCS_options_used_during_installation">Is
        there a way to find out FreeLCS options used during installation ?</a></h2>
    <p>Yes. FreeLCS 3.0 creates an installation log file in <strong>/var/log/.</strong>
      The name of the logfile is something like:&nbsp; <strong>freelcs_installation_log_2014.06.02_at_14.15.04.txt</strong>.&nbsp;
      The date and time in the file name corresponds to the time FreeLCS
      installer was run.</p>
    <p>The logfile is meant for the developer for debugging purposes and the log
      lists values assigned during installation to FreeLCS internal variables.
      Since the variable names are quite clear and easy to understand, the user
      can deduce with little effort how options were set during installation.
      The logfile also lists variables that are not user configurable, for
      example: <strong>delay_between_directory_reads = 5</strong>&nbsp; means
      FreeLCS checks in 5 second intervals for new files in the HotFolder.
      Options are divided to sections roughly corresponding each page in the
      installer program.</p>
    <p>One example where the user might want to check the logfile is when there
      is need to know what email addresses are FreeLCS error messages sent to.
      The third section in the logfile lists email settings including email
      addresses error messages are sent to.</p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h3>Example: installation logfile<br>
    </h3>
    Here is an example from one of my test installations. I have added some
    explanations in parentheses. You can list the logfile with a command like:<em><strong><br>
      </strong></em>
    <p><em><strong>cat &nbsp;
          /var/log/freelcs_installation_log_2014.06.02_at_14.15.04.txt </strong></em><br>
