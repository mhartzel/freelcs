    2014.06.05 FreeLCS 3.0 released.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>This new release adds major new features. If you are happy with your
        current FreeLCS 2.3 or 2.4 installation then there is no reason to
        upgrade :)</li>
      <li>Support for Debian 7, Ubuntu 12.04 Server, Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop and
        Server added. Note that installation on <a href="file:///mounttipiste/Sailytettava_Tavara-Digiboxi/00-Yhteinen_Kotidirri/00-eCyptsFS-Auki/Koodaus/freelcs/Documentation/Debian_modifications_needed_before_FreeLCS_installation.html">Debian
          7</a> and <a href="file:///mounttipiste/Sailytettava_Tavara-Digiboxi/00-Yhteinen_Kotidirri/00-eCyptsFS-Auki/Koodaus/freelcs/Documentation/Ubuntu_Server_modifications_needed_before_FreeLCS_installation.html">Ubuntu
          Server</a> requires some modifications to the operating system
        configuration before installation.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS 3.0 is able to <a href="file:///mounttipiste/Sailytettava_Tavara-Digiboxi/00-Yhteinen_Kotidirri/00-eCyptsFS-Auki/Koodaus/freelcs/Documentation/Machine_readable_results_and_MXF_audio_remix_mapping.html#Machine_readable_results">write
          loudness results to a machine readable file</a>. With this feature you
        can make FreeLCS the loudness measurement step in your automated file
        processing workflow. You can also configure FreeLCS not to produce any
        output files (loudness corrected audio files, history graphics) since
        these might not be needed in an automated workflow.</li>
      <li>With FreeLCS 3.0 you can define how audio channels inside an MXF file
        will be combined to new mixes before loudness processing. The feature is
        called <a href="file:///mounttipiste/Sailytettava_Tavara-Digiboxi/00-Yhteinen_Kotidirri/00-eCyptsFS-Auki/Koodaus/freelcs/Documentation/Machine_readable_results_and_MXF_audio_remix_mapping.html#MXF_audio_remixing">MXF
          audio remixing</a>.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS is no longer tested with FFmpeg since FFmpeg is no longer
        easily available in Ubuntu 14.04 repositories. The only common tool
        easily avaible to Debian 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 users is avconv
        from libav-tools. FreeLCS 3.0 uses avconv if it is installed by the
        user. There is a small known problem with the avconv version that ships
        with Ubuntu 14.04 , <a href="file:///mounttipiste/Sailytettava_Tavara-Digiboxi/00-Yhteinen_Kotidirri/00-eCyptsFS-Auki/Koodaus/freelcs/Documentation/known_problems.txt">read
          about it here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    2013.12.04 FreeLCS 2.4 released.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Libebur128 source code repository that FreeLCS uses during
        installation was reorganized by its author. The change broke
        installation for FreeLCS 2.3 and older. I uploaded my backup of original
        libebur128 source code to github and updated FreeLCS installer to
        install libebur128 from this new repository.</li>
      <li>All installations made before this change will continue to work fine,
        but new installations or restoring an old backup made with FreeLCS 2.3
        backup-tool won't work anymore. All new installations must be done with
        version 2.4. Sorry for the inconvenience.</li>
      <li>If you made a backup of your server using the tool provided in FreeLCS
        2.3 zip, then please download FreeLCS version 2.4 and make a new backup.
        The restore script in version 2.3 uses the original libebur128
        repository and it does not work the way it used to when FreeLCS 2.3 was
        released.</li>
      <li>There is no new functionality in this release (though some new
        features are under development :)</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2013.03.29</strong> FreeLCS 2.3 released.
    <h4> </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> This is a maintenance bug fix release.</li>
      <li>Fixes a bug made in FreeLCS version 2.2 that affects only output files
        bigger than 4 GB. When the output file was split to separate mono
        channels, some channels were missing.</li>
      <li>Fixed a number of ways LoudnessCorrection.py could be crashed by
        deleting files that it was already processing.</li>
      <li>Added a new script to backup / clone FreeLCS installation to another
        Ubuntu machine. The script does not require X and can be used over a ssh
        - connection. This functionality can be used to create automation that
        clones FreeLCS installation to several machines quickly and easily. Read
        about it <a href="file:///tavara/00-eCryptsFS-Auki/Koodaus/freelcs/Documentation/FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Cloning%20a%20FreeLCS%20installation%20to%20another%20machine%20%28without%20a%20display%29">here</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2013.03.10 FreeLCS 2.2 released.<br>
    </strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong></strong>This is a maintenance bug fix release. This version
        fixes a couple of bugs that sometimes caused file processing to hang.
        This release also adds code that catches possible Python error messages
        and sends them to the user. This helps to identify what situation caused
        the error.</li>
      <li>Addition to the manual "How to synchronize server clock to a NTP
        server".</li>
      <li>Correction to manual: "Use UUID as the device name when configuring
        software raid". This solves the problem where raid device number
        sometimes changes when a kernel update is installed.</li>
      <li>The installer no longer installs FFmpeg, but if the user does, then
        FFmpeg is used for file processing.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2012.10.11</strong> FreeLCS 2.1 released.
    <ul>
      <li>This release fixes a bug: bit depth was not preserved if input file
        had many audio streams with uncompressed audio in it.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2012.10.01:</strong> FreeLCS 2.0 released :)
    <ul>
      <li>This is an important bug fix release and everybody should upgrade.</li>
      <li>Fixes a large number of bugs and undesired behaviors in FreeLCS and
        includes several enhancements.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixes a couple of problems in helper programs libebur128 and sox. The
        sox version 14.3.2 that comes with Ubuntu 12.04 is not able to handle
        bigger than 4 GB files correctly. FreeLCS installer now downloads sox
        source code and compiles and installs version 14.4.0 that fixes the
        problem.</li>
      <li>Supported channel orders are now defined (<a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#What%20channel%20orders%20are%20supported%20?">see
          FAQ</a>).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Libebur128 is patched to support channel orders: 4.0 (L, R, LS, RS)
        and 5.0 (L, R, C, LFE, LS, RS). These were previously not supported.</li>
      <li>Libebur128 developer fixed a bug that caused loudness calculation to
        hang when processing lots of very short files.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Behaviour for files bigger than 4 GB is now defined (<a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#What%20happens%20if%20output%20file%20size%20exceeds%20wav%20format%204%20GB%20size%20limit%20?">see
          FAQ</a>).</li>
      <li>Complete log of all changes is in the <a href="Changelog.txt">changelog</a>.<a
          href="file:///home/mika/freelcs/Documentation/Changelog.txt"></a></li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2012.07.16:</strong> Bugfix release 1.01. Also added the possibility
    to select between sample peak and TruePeak measurement in the installer.<strong><br>
      2012.07.08:</strong> First public release of FreeLCS 1.00.
