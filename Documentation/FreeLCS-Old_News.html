    <h2><strong>Old news:</strong></h2>
    <div>2023.09.23 FreeLCS 3.9 released.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>This release supports Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04.</li>
        <li>Disabled FFmpeg dependencies from libebur128 loudness - executable
          since they wont build anymore. It seems FFmpeg API has changed and
          libebur128 loudness_scanner has not kept up with the changes. However
          ffmpeg bindings are not needed for anything in FreeLCS, because it
          uses the FFmpeg - executable installed in the os.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p style="margin-left: -5px;">2022.07.27 FreeLCS 3.8 released.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This release supports Debian 11, Ubuntu 22.04 and 20.04.</li>
      <li>Libebur128 upgraded to latest version 1.2.6.</li>
      <li>Libebur128 no longer natively supports 8 bit audio so 8 bit files are
        converted to 16 bits if FFmpeg is installed.</li>
      <li>Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian 11 ships with broken mediainfo that hangs
        reading some 32 bit files.&nbsp; FreeLCS installs fixed version 22.06
        from official mediainfo site: <a href="https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo">https://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: -8px;">2020.04.30 FreeLCS 3.7 released.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This release supports Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and Debian 10.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug that might have caused a crash when a BWF or MP2 file had
        user entered metadata (text) in some other encoding than UTF-8.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p style="margin-left: -9px;">2019.08.24 FreeLCS 3.6 released.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This release supports Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and Debian 9 and 10.</li>
      <li>It is now possible to change target loudness in the range of -31 LUFS
        to -12 LUFS. This makes it possible to adjust loudness to a level that
        is more compatible with internet media sites (Youtube, Spotify, mobile
        devices, social media, etc). There are some things to be aware of when
        using higher than -23 LUFS target loudness levels. They are discussed <a
          href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#Considerations%20for%20using%20a%20target%20loudness%20higher%20than%20-23%20LUFS"
          title="Considerations for using a target loudness higher than -23 LUFS">here</a>.
        Target loudness graphics is drawn using <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Loudness%20history%20graphics%20when%20target%20loudness%20is%20set%20to%20-16,%20-23%20and%20-31%20LUFS"
          title="Loudness history graphics when target loudness is set to -16, -23 and -31 LUFS">different
          colors depending on if target is set lower, equal or higher than -23
          LUFS</a>. Hotfolder name also changes depending on the <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Hotfolder_Name"
          title="Hotfolder_Name">selected target loudness.</a></li>
      <li>Loudness history graphics and html progress report now uses UTF-8
        character encoding.</li>
      <li>Debian 10 has AppArmor turned on by default but this does not seem to
        affect FreeLCS installation in any way. This is further discussed in the
        FAQ <a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#AppArmor">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p style="margin-left: -5px;">2018.05.25 FreeLCS 3.5 released.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This release supports Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and Debian 8 and 9.</li>
      <li>Patents for Dolby AC3, Mpeg 1 Layers 1, 2 and 3 (mp1, mp2, mp3 ) have
        expired all over the world. These formats are now patent free and can be
        used legally without paying anybody for a license. These formats (and
        the Opus - format) are now enabled if you enable free formats during
        FreeLCS installation. Extracting audio from these formats still require
        installation of FFmpeg / Libav-tools.</li>
      <li>Libebur128 upgraded to the latest version 1.2.4. Libebur128 by default
        builds taglib into the 'loudness' executable. Taglib does not build
        cleanly anymore on older distros probably due to old gcc - versions.
        Because of this building taglib with libebur128 is disabled on Debian 8
        and Ubuntu 16.04. Taglib is used to read and write metadata into files
        (For Example ID3 - data in mp3 files), so you probably don't need it for
        anything anyway. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TagLib">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TagLib</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p style="margin-left: -10px;"> 2017.08.30 FreeLCS 3.4 released.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This release supports Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04 and Debian 8 and 9.</li>
      <li>Libebur128 is upgraded to the latest version 1.2.2. The new version
        uses a new method to calculate true peak values. I'm testing each new
        FreeLCS release with the same set of&nbsp; 214 files (35 GB). 192 of
        them measure the same truepeak value as with the previous version of
        libebur128. The rest of them get mostly a lower truepeak value than
        before. Loudness measurement&nbsp; with the new version of libebur128
        gives the same results as before.</li>
      <li>Libebur128 version 1.2.2 source archive is included in the FreeLCS
        installation package. So now you don't have to have an internet
        connection while you install FreeLCS as long as you have access to a
        local Debian / Ubuntu package repository.</li>
      <li>Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 dropped the ram disk driver (brd module) from
        the kernel in the middle of the support cycle. Updated kernel does no
        longer include the brd module built in. Debian also does not load brd by
        default, so FreeLCS 3.4 now handles loading of the brd module
        automatically if the module is not loaded or built into kernel.</li>
      <li>If you need to disable the smb protocol version1 then remove the
        character # from smb.conf in front of line: # server min protocol = SMB2</li>
    </ul>
    <span style="font-weight: normal;"></span>
    <p></p>
    2016.07.01 FreeLCS 3.3 released. 2016.07.01 FreeLCS 3.3 released.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>This release supports Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 and Debian 8. Support for
        Ubuntu 12.04 and Debian 7 is dropped.</li>
    </ul>
    2015.10.05 FreeLCS 3.2 released.
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li> This release adds support for Debian 8 that introduces a new os
        startup system called systemd. Systemd introduces some changes to how
        the operating system is started up, so FreeLCS needed to adjust to these
        changes. </li>
      <li> FreeLCS 3.2 supports Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 14.04, Debian 7 and Debian
        8. IMPORTANT !!!!!!! Ubuntu 12.04 updates brings in a broken version of
        python3. <a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#Ubuntu_12.04_updates_breaks_python3">Here
          are two possible solutions to the problem</a>. </li>
      <li> Fixed a small bug: the HeartBeat_Checker program crashed if the
        computer started up and could not get an ip - address. What
        HeartBeat_Checker does is <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#HeartBeat_Checker_Explained">explained
          here</a>. </li>
      <li> I stumbled upon a&nbsp; problem with OS X versions 10.7 - 10.10 and
        their smb - protocol implementation. This causes problems when files are
        copied over from these OS X versions to the FreeLCS - server. I also
        found two workarounds, <a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#Errors_copying_files_from_OS_X_10.7-10.10_to_FreeLCS-Server">read
          more about it here</a>. </li>
      <li> Ubuntu 12.04 updates brings in a broken version of python3. <a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#Ubuntu_12.04_updates_breaks_python3">Here
          are two possible solutions to the problem</a>. </li>
      <li> No changes to the processing of audio files. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    2014.09.11 FreeLCS 3.1 released
    <ul>
      <li>This minor update only fixes one bug that caused 3 - 4 unnecessary
        error messages per week complaining that the FreeLCS server could not
        find out what it's IP - address was. FreeLCS prints the IP - address of
        the server on the "<a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Html%20Progress%20report">Html
          progress report</a>" and the server needs to check periodically if the
        IP - address has changed. No other changes to FreeLCS functionality in
        this release :)</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    2014.06.05 FreeLCS 3.0 released.
    <p> </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This new release adds major new features. If you are happy with your
        current FreeLCS 2.3 or 2.4 installation then there is no reason to
        upgrade :)</li>
      <li>Support for Debian 7, Ubuntu 12.04 Server, Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop and
        Server added. Note that installation on <a href="Debian_modifications_needed_before_FreeLCS_installation.html">Debian
          7</a> and <a href="Ubuntu_Server_modifications_needed_before_FreeLCS_installation.html">Ubuntu
          Server</a> requires some modifications to the operating system
        configuration before installation.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS 3.0 is able to <a href="Machine_readable_results_and_MXF_audio_remix_mapping.html#Machine_readable_results">write
          loudness results to a machine readable file</a>. With this feature you
        can make FreeLCS the loudness measurement step in your automated file
        processing workflow. You can also configure FreeLCS not to produce any
        output files (loudness corrected audio files, history graphics) since
        these might not be needed in an automated workflow.</li>
      <li>With FreeLCS 3.0 you can define how audio channels inside an MXF file
        will be combined to new mixes before loudness processing. The feature is
        called <a href="Machine_readable_results_and_MXF_audio_remix_mapping.html#MXF_audio_remixing">MXF
          audio remixing</a>.</li>
      <li>FreeLCS is no longer tested with FFmpeg since FFmpeg is no longer
        easily available in Ubuntu 14.04 repositories. The only common tool
        easily avaible to Debian 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 users is avconv
        from libav-tools. FreeLCS 3.0 uses avconv if it is installed by the
        user. There is a small known problem with the avconv version that ships
        with Ubuntu 14.04 , <a href="known_problems.txt">read about it here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    2013.12.04 FreeLCS 2.4 released.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Libebur128 source code repository that FreeLCS uses during
        installation was reorganized by its author. The change broke
        installation for FreeLCS 2.3 and older. I uploaded my backup of original
        libebur128 source code to github and updated FreeLCS installer to
        install libebur128 from this new repository.</li>
      <li>All installations made before this change will continue to work fine,
        but new installations or restoring an old backup made with FreeLCS 2.3
        backup-tool won't work anymore. All new installations must be done with
        version 2.4. Sorry for the inconvenience.</li>
      <li>If you made a backup of your server using the tool provided in FreeLCS
        2.3 zip, then please download FreeLCS version 2.4 and make a new backup.
        The restore script in version 2.3 uses the original libebur128
        repository and it does not work the way it used to when FreeLCS 2.3 was
        released.</li>
      <li>There is no new functionality in this release (though some new
        features are under development :)</li>
    </ul>
    2013.03.11 <span style="font-weight: normal;">Released introductory
      material about EBU R128 recommendation and FreeLCS. This version is in
      Finnish language only. The material tries to explain R128 concepts and
      FreeLCS usage in the point of view of a common user.&nbsp; Read it here: <a

        Hallinta</a>.</span>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <strong>2013.03.29</strong> FreeLCS 2.3 released.
    <h4> </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> This is a maintenance bug fix release.</li>
      <li>Fixes a bug made in FreeLCS version 2.2 that affects only output files
        bigger than 4 GB. When the output file was split to separate mono
        channels, some channels were missing.</li>
      <li>Fixed a number of ways LoudnessCorrection.py could be crashed by
        deleting files that it was already processing.</li>
      <li>Added a new script to backup / clone FreeLCS installation to another
        Ubuntu machine. The script does not require X and can be used over a ssh
        - connection. This functionality can be used to create automation that
        clones FreeLCS installation to several machines quickly and easily. Read
        about it <a href="FreeLCS_User_Manual.html#Cloning%20a%20FreeLCS%20installation%20to%20another%20machine%20%28without%20a%20display%29">here</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2013.03.10 FreeLCS 2.2 released.<br>
    </strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong></strong>This is a maintenance bug fix release. This version
        fixes a couple of bugs that sometimes caused file processing to hang.
        This release also adds code that catches possible Python error messages
        and sends them to the user. This helps to identify what situation caused
        the error.</li>
      <li>Addition to the manual "How to synchronize server clock to a NTP
        server".</li>
      <li>Correction to manual: "Use UUID as the device name when configuring
        software raid". This solves the problem where raid device number
        sometimes changes when a kernel update is installed.</li>
      <li>The installer no longer installs FFmpeg, but if the user does, then
        FFmpeg is used for file processing.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2012.10.11</strong> FreeLCS 2.1 released.
    <ul>
      <li>This release fixes a bug: bit depth was not preserved if input file
        had many audio streams with uncompressed audio in it.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2012.10.01:</strong> FreeLCS 2.0 released :)
    <ul>
      <li>This is an important bug fix release and everybody should upgrade.</li>
      <li>Fixes a large number of bugs and undesired behaviors in FreeLCS and
        includes several enhancements.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Fixes a couple of problems in helper programs libebur128 and sox. The
        sox version 14.3.2 that comes with Ubuntu 12.04 is not able to handle
        bigger than 4 GB files correctly. FreeLCS installer now downloads sox
        source code and compiles and installs version 14.4.0 that fixes the
        problem.</li>
      <li>Supported channel orders are now defined (<a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#What%20channel%20orders%20are%20supported%20?">see
          FAQ</a>).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Libebur128 is patched to support channel orders: 4.0 (L, R, LS, RS)
        and 5.0 (L, R, C, LFE, LS, RS). These were previously not supported.</li>
      <li>Libebur128 developer fixed a bug that caused loudness calculation to
        hang when processing lots of very short files.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Behaviour for files bigger than 4 GB is now defined (<a href="FreeLCS_FAQ.html#What%20happens%20if%20output%20file%20size%20exceeds%20wav%20format%204%20GB%20size%20limit%20?">see
          FAQ</a>).</li>
      <li>Complete log of all changes is in the <a href="Changelog.txt">changelog</a>.<a
          href="file:///home/mika/freelcs/Documentation/Changelog.txt"></a></li>
    </ul>
    <strong>2012.07.16:</strong> Bugfix release 1.01. Also added the possibility
    to select between sample peak and TruePeak measurement in the installer.<strong><br>
      2012.07.08:</strong> First public release of FreeLCS 1.00.
